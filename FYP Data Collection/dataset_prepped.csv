"Invite the people to boycott the upcoming box office movies that will be released soon. Don’t forget that the movie industry is also their biggest contributor, what’s more, the movie Wonder Woman clearly shows the perpetrators of the Jewish race. Try to see the movie in the Mat Kilau country box office in our country alone, how much has it collected."
"JE LAST YEAR THE MOVIE Mat Kilau OUT OI! LIKE OR HATE THAT MOVIE IT’S A MOVIE LITERALLY ABOUT OUR ANCESTORS FIGHTING BRITISH COLONIZERS, WHAT A STUPID NAK NEUTRAL2 WHEN A LITERAL GENOCIDE IS HAPPENING!

THOSE WHO THINK OF SUPPORTING THE COLONIZERS AGAIN CAN BE PULLED OUT! PTUI!"
Watched Mat Kilau for Friday night movie and then wave the  flag on Sunday for the Prince. Some Makcik logic.
"Me explaining to my colleague how Hamas is penjuang tuntut kemerdekaan blablabla

Her: oh you mean, alike Daud Kilau?

Me:...
Photocopy machine:...
Claim form:...
Me: Mat Kilau? Macam movie tu, you mean?"
"Of course, Mat Kilau is a fighter. He fought against the oppression of his time. @jobzasia , he’s not a gangster who collects taxes. Gangster people are number 1 running away from war. lg 1, fuck movie mat kilau. hehehehe"
"Bila tahu je anak ku lelaki, I got so inspired dengan bravery dorang ni. Time tu pun tgh peak dgn movie mat kilau.

Like I really wanted and I prayed my son to have this kind of bravery and pegangan kepada Islam tu teguh dalam sanubari dia.

Hence his name now"
He remembers him as Mat Kilau in the movie who hates colonial English
"I remember the time of the phenomenon of the movie Mat Kilau, when more and more people were proud to be Malay, wearing traditional clothes, at that time there were many crazy people who didn’t like it, understand where it came from. These things will make Malay extremists like the Taliban. It is not impossible that the Malays themselves will come under the terrorist stamp"
Mat kilau Indian movie
sorry I never watched the movie until the end. What did he say?
"eh, I don’t misunderstand, I don’t know that sentence because I’ve never seen a Mat Kilau movie until the end"
Sbb 4 them israeli akn bunuh diorang slowly sbb nk buat ethnic cleansing. Fight instead waiting to die. Nk tgu level army sma mmg xnknla..we watch ‘mat kilau’ the movie and yet we still question ppl who fought against occupation.
"Finally watched Mat Kilau yesterday

No other Malaysian movie could match its theatrical, comedic and historic-inaccuracy value...

Best line:
""Keris yang menyilau, aku dipanggil Mat Kilau"""
"That’s why in the movie mat kilau, the British captain once said, we are a weak nation, a divided nation, we are never United. That’s why you’re weak. What he said is true, I agree, if we all unite, our nation will be strong. It is sad that our nation is divided"
"always proud of what our nation can achieved. I support local films. To do better we need to compete productively. In this era, the source of movies are limitless. Ola Bola, Mat Kilau to name a few are all local blockbuster. Give it sometimes for local films to grow."
"Hamas is a Hero for Palistinian, see movie ""Mat Kilau"", how he defend Melayu land from british colonial . Did he a terrorist?"
"about reading a book to know this history, I once talked to someone who saw the movie Mat Kilau and completely believed what he showed.

when I told him to read a book, he said I don’t know Malay. I’m too lazy to debate with people who want to go to the toilet and ask the boss."
The same person blames the Malays for the controversy movie Mat Kilau Tu dulu.
"I also remember that Mat Kilau movie that wasn’t the best, it was so dark and stressful to watch"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau. Although situation our predecessors in Malay Archipelago had passed through were much more harder, movies like this need to be massively produced to make us always remember that kafir and Kuffar nations will always be our enemy then and now."
MALAYSIANS remember when we all obsessed over Mat Kilau (the movie)? especially the girls when we thought some of the 6 casts were attractive
"I don’t even quote Mat Kilau because I know his history is not the same as what I read in the book, so people use the movie as an ideology. Sometimes I ask gangs who watch this movie, are there certain scenes that don’t follow history..."
Annoying Voice of Hun Haqiem = Movie Mat Kilau
"Really though. Mat Kilau is a far better movie than this, and Mat Kilau was ahistorical ethnonationalist diarrhea.

Hot take time! My bet for best Malaysian movie of the last few years is, and don’t kill me for this: PASKAL. That was a fucking kinetic film."
"When you look at the pig, it’s good to cry when you watch the movie"
"Yes, I opened the movie because I wanted to cry, I was already looking for the sad part. But look at the Mat Kilau and cry hahaha"
remind me there is a parade from the cast of the movie eramalat cuz last year there was a Mat Kilau
"Wow, have you seen it? Fast sis ! Nooo Mat Kilau was the worst Malay movie ever! Until now, the trauma of going to see the movie is a waste of 20+ sisters . 6.5 is okay after 5 . How many Paskal levels are there?"
"Mat Kilau/Polis Evo 3/Paskal
( All Are Malaysian Movies But OMG The Best )"
"But honestly, Mat Kilau is not very strong plot-wise. The movie has strong support because it has a political element."
"There is a Kanang Anak Kankau movie. Even made earlier than Mat Kilau.

The Borneo women just make it worse, they say we are racist to them.

Very influenced to be like a black American I guess"
"There is a movie Kanang Anak Skip. Even made earlier than Mat Kilau.

The only thing that makes it worse for women is that we are racist towards them. Very influenced by the black American narrative."
"Mat kilau movie singlehandedly helps PN won the PRN. Ytjt

Mat kilau >>"
"If the film really followed the historical facts about Mat Kilau, it would appear 10 times supremacy because he really fought like hell.

His life story is sad. He was under-appreciated tbh."
The Mat Kilau is fine. There are many other movies available. He can be blamed for the Mat Kilau of a movie. What is the fate of the people of Malaysia
"Just watched Sultan Agung on Netflix.
I must say every single thing in this movie is far beyond better than Mat Kilau. 

Story telling : 10
Plot : 10
Script :10
Cinematography : 9
Acting : 10"
"The film Mat Kilau is also selling well, what do you expect"
Who is excited to watch the Mat Kilau movie until they cry?
I don’t think that’s the reason. The people are now ready to vote..nonsensical stories have no essence. What do you want to support? An example of Mat Kilau film.
"I thought I will never be able to find an even worse film than Mat Kilau: I was wrong. Iceman : The Time Traveller was a total mess and cringefest. How the fuck dud that movie even got released, yuck"
"fak you men mat kilau haters, mat kilau shat on these movies bro"
"Tbh right now, you gimme one podium and i read out what i have, i sound like im in the mat kilau movie sak."
Greta Gerwig’s movies are deffo not to Malay tastes in Meleisia. I guess they’d rather stick to their Mat Kilau movies.
Mat Kilau movies like that are also high-grossing. Good quality Evo police can’t even get the collection they deserve. Uhuks
"nak lawan action-packed Mat Kilau, memg kalah laa Christopher Nolan.

p/s : Mat Kilau (the film) is not a movie, it’s a piece of #%*^."
"Look at the acceptance of our people. Just look at what happened at mat kilau movies, it’s clear dear."
"In my experience doing startup is investor will put money in ventures that they can relate with. 

So I guess FINAS people are those who like these kinds of movie, not Star Wars, Shutter Island and Mat Kilau."
"Aaaaa… me!!! There are good Malay movies, for example PASKAL. EVO POLICE. KURAFAT Mat Kilau. And also the movies of late mamat khalid."
"Ever since I watched the movie Mat Kilau, my language has improved a lot...."
"Where ? We were in MMU Theater competitions together. Perempuan Itu (lama tak tgk TV especially Malay drama) is it Isma’s ? Years dah I never followed, last Malay stories I watched was Mat Kilau & the aviation movie tu."
"Jd composer lagu dan penerbit filem.
Apa lagu/movie yg hit sekarang, aku bagi kat diri 10tahun yang dulu  

Contoh movie Mat Kilau dan lagu terus hidup bagi kat aina abdul"
"My cousins are watching Mat Kilau so I watched it too

What is this movie bro"
"Indonesia can produce films like Big 4 and Hitmen but we are still stuck with Polis Evo and Mat Kilau.
Indonesia can produce films like Qodrat but Malaysia is still stuck with Munafik. owwwwww"
Uncle. I just finished watching Extraction 2. Is Sol Mat Kilau who shot the movie?
Lama nokk tak tengok movie last tengok mat kilau dekat ecm
Hahaha I can’t even see it. Not to mention the upcoming movie.
"His camera work is not like the style I did in the Mat Kilau film, and it is not like the Kingsman style of camera work. I don’t remember what movie it was, but it’s not like a typical mission impossible movie or common action movie camera work, it’s different."
Short snippets of Mat Kilau movie will now be used to advanced identity politics of race and religion as many have start emerging on social media ! Using the snippets out of context can and may inflame people ! 6 state elections are coming ! Contest based on ideas / policies
"Top 10 highest grossers in Malaysia:

Puteri gunung ledang movie is so nice. It is beautifully written and it is exactly what mat kilau’s writer had ever dreamed of but could never come close to it
"I have to make a quality movie to lift my spirits 

History - ""Mat Kilau""
BM -
BI -
Math -
Science -"
"hahaha...movie Mat Kilau, of all things"
and thought it is so hilarious he chose to make reference from a dialogue in movie Mat Kilau to support his view ??? hahaha...adoiii
"Let’s just look at the movie, how do people who are ignorant of history follow what they want to use. Don’t look at it comprehensively. The one who makes the movie and the one who watches the movie. The mentality is the same."
"Polis evo 3 is good. It’s not powerful, but it’s delicious. I don’t think it’s a waste to watch a local movie like this near the cinema. Light plot. Action sequence is nice, even better than Mat Kilau in terms of sound and camera angle. The armor plot is thick, but if you look at one piece, you don’t even complain. 6.5/10."
"have to make sure that the movie that is made is the best, it’s crazy, then it’s hype, then the quotes beat the Mat Kilau, then people can see positive things"
"What to do, with the recent voting trends by the first time voters, influences by dumb tiktok videos, not capable of thinking, movies like mat Kilau which portrays non as enemy.... This route is taken to get votes."
"Just watched polis evo 3. Was an okay movie. Predictable plot. 6/10 for me.
BOOT!! Everyone else laughed and enjoyed the movie so much. Ready to get applause from people in the movie hall. 
But this one gets applause better than the trashy Mat Kilau movie"
"Mat Kilau is historical, not a stupid political quote. If you want to make a movie to promote yourself, you have to wait for it first."
"Movie Mat Kilau best. All of us are excited about the anti-colonial side. Ready to fall in love with martial arts.
Anwar’s movie, no appeal. I’m asking the boys now, has this movie gone viral?"
"It’s no problem.. you can do it.. you don’t want it.. it’s not weird for promotion.. as an example, there are also films like this.. if you want to make a movie about Pas characters.. don’t bother.. already confirm 1.8 billion worldwide views.."
I compared with mat kilau for no apparent reasons. Just being bitter bcs the movie sucks balls.
"But even if i have to, this movie needs to exist (just like Mat Kilau), to make way for better biopics in the future.

Or how not to."
"Ermm.. it feels like there are many free tickets at mat kilau.. I got free tickets at mat kilau 4 times.. police evo 3 twice.. I haven’t been able to get this anwar untold story because it’s fun to run out of free ones.. just like any free movie I’ve ever had I don’t know hahahah.. if it’s possible, I’ll do it like this for another movie heheheheh"
"I just finished watching it. Aq perati One2 seats that show full on the website n All are full. Also, other people come. Yes, there are free tickets. But there are other movies too (tanda putera, Mat Kilau). Why are you fussing?"
"So, bangnon movies with Mat Kilaus, where else? Dialogue, story line, cinematography"
"Mat Kilau.Iklan terlebih.Aku terkena juga.Bila tengok,hampeh.1 plot lama Cinema pun bg full slots/day instead of 4 slots/day per cinema movie Anwar."
"right? The other day, it was said that it can be used against sale Mat Kilau. to make a movie that doesn’t use this hill can only be a dream. hdshs"
"Make fun of him because he doesn’t focus on the story line and then tears up.. The message of the movie is good and important, there’s no touch plaque.. The movie doesn’t have a Mat Kilau finish, it’s not a rush, it’s a lot of citations, it’s fine even if you press the psl of the racial issue, you need to take care of the Malays.. You’re just dizzy.."
"Mat Kilau > Anwar

*In terms of movie la tapi."
"Anwar & Mat Kilau movie.
I’ve noticed that Malaysians are too much against/glorifying the fact that films like fact/documentaries. Of course there are inaccuracies/fallacies. Do you really believe that Leonardo Dicaprio died on the Titanic?? It’s just a movie, bro. Just enjoy it as it is."
"do movie on Mahathir instead, first day can collect 10 million ringgit and consistently getting 5 - 10 million ringgit for 30 weeks. bok dapat kalahkan Mat Kilau"
"Dua-dua tak best. 

Objectively speaking, this movie opened strong then withered as an unnecessary PSA that made the ending feel abrupt. 

Mat Kilau was horrifying in terms of blatant propaganda packaged as a warrior story."
"Farid Kamil should call him chubby first before he watches the film, then he will get a high rating like Mat Kilau"
We need to make more movies like Mat Kilau than movies involving stupid politicians
"Yeahh in a Malaysia movie ""Mat Kilau "" he was a good fighter"
"Aku tgok movie mat kilau. 

Betol laa dia cakap. Melayu mulia sbb akidah sbb agama islam"
"Memali The Movie if you style opponents like Mat Kilau, it’s best. Who is suitable to hold the character of ayoh chik? Hasnul like in Polis Evo 2 is also ok, right?"
"...aku X kecam movie orang kata 10/10, dia menganjing orang lain. Padahal sendiri review 5/5 mat kilau.  Bodoh piang."
"Example for me, I strongly disagree with reviewers who said Mat Kilau was the best. I don’t even like the other movies he recommends. So I ignore him.

Chris Stuckkman (?) doesn’t recommend a lot of stories that I like. There are a few that don’t match but so far I’m satisfied"
mat kilau last movie i saw zhaf’s review
"I don’t know, I didn’t even look at it again but... Mat Kilau gave him 5/5? Wtf

If you want to make a historical film, make it like Lieutenant Adnan, Bukit Kepong, Bang Rajan. It’s just real, this is a market in a Mat Kilau film like a village nasi lemak stall"
Mat Kilau the movie sgt best.
diammm sibuk je. back up orang yang 5/5 mat kilau xde taste movie. BOO SIAL
Is there anyone else who reviews this movie? he turned away with a Mat Kilau coat
"When I first wanted to watch this PMX movie, I remembered Mat Kilau, but then it didn’t happen. Hrmm, don’t be afraid of wasting money & time."
"I didn’t see it until the end of his review. He praises has a basis, he criticizes curses has a basis. You are exaggerating. Why only mention Mat Kilau? He praises animated movies. He licks you too?"
"Even Mat Kilau can get 5/10. In 4/10 only. Watch twice, fall asleep twice. I’ve never fallen asleep watching a movie at the cinema, but Mat Kilau is alas...boring."
Why do you want to compare Mat Kilau with Movie Bang Non? Movie Bang Non Are there opponents fighting?
"Aah, it’s the same. We’ll see that it’s okay, that Mat Kilau. I don’t even think about the movie. Look for fun. If it’s fun, it’s fun. But it’s true, after he made sarah cem it became a waste of soles"
"Selain daripada movie mat kilau overrated, haters pun overrated hate filem tu kt twitter"
"Sampai hari ni aku pelik, camana mamat terpaling review movie tu bagi rating tinggi kat mat kilau tu.
Dia tu kalau review, selalu tekankan aspek sinematografi, tapi dalam mat kilau, hancur teruk. Kamera gegaq tu toksah habaq la. Campelaq.
Tu yang sus tu."
I suspect the Mat Kilau movie will have to be re-quoted if the review is bad
That’s the quantity. Great a movie based on quality not quantity. That’s the level of taste Malaysians want to make. Do many Malaysians watch the highest rated movie worldwide? That’s why it flopped when it entered the Indonesian market. The quality of Indonesian movies is much better

"Why did I think of Bell? Hahahaha eheh Beto in Mat Kilau. After the movie, he eclipsed everyone1 I think. This Raya, his face is everywhere! + The starry moon & the sweet fat song are all over"
"Just watched Mat Kilau
Why did they treat Mat Kilau’s fight scenes as the characters were superheroes...

The movie itself was OKAY but the glaring issues came from the fight scenes and Captain Syers (his writing was honestly pretty comical it was horrendous)"
Better than all malaysian movies better than camera shake mat
Rakam’s father is also uki. In the movie mat kilau darkweb ke apa
"After the Mat Kilau movie, everybody is a pendekar."
"first of all, i never agree with people who condescends the legend Mat Kilau himself, ofc he is one of our national heroes. however, it is never a reason for people to justify shamsul bcs the movie just was terrible and deceptive for so many reasons"
"Yeah because whenever I found a guy idolising mat kilau, he’s referring to syamsul yusof’s movie"
"Mat Kilau , the first film in a lifetime.
Soo next we wait,
Malbat Mission Bakara | Black Hawk Down .

As for history, he follows what America and the West wrote. Auto Blacklist."
Shamsul Yusof. I want to make a Mat Kilau movie using CGI
"because I don’t know you very well, not because of race. If Chin View is making a movie with Mat Kilau and Yusof Haslam’s son or the devil boy actor, what’s the point? lol. like the case of shooting a pregnant wife, because the perpetrators are not female so there is no hype. That’s because he is."
"Those who deny that the British committed murder, destroyed houses, killed villagers in Pahang like in the movie Mat Kilau.. you should see the episode of the Messenger’s Footsteps today.. there is an academic to explain.."

add on malay movie xlaku this year n maybe mat kilau is in the raya list this year
"That’s right, when the movie Mat Kilau was already dropped, it was said that it was racist"
what if Malaysia were to make film on Mahsuri history? would it have a great feedback and engagements such as Mat Kilau and other historic movies?
There are many black raya themes this year. Then the pot bay. The effect of film Mat Kilau customer says
"Many movies I’ve seen in the cinema, but the are the most wasteful. The hype is more about the story, he is biased, just more about the war scene"
Wow. Movie Mat Kilau 2 is coming
Can the camera man register to be a camera man for the next Mat Kilau movie
Imagine the camera work in this movie is better than Mat Kilau tah maybe choreography is also better.
It’s not from the Mat Kilau movie
i saw munafik and mat kilau movies and i feel like they are made are made for boring people  it is so... local omggg. usually love the direction and theme of these but the execution and script are rubbish lmao
lastly got the movie leak story of Mat Kilau full movie apparently isn’t it
"We have never been interested in his movie genres since the beginning, except for the latest one, it’s a bit dull. I was never interested in his previous movie."
"People say that Mat Kilau movie is bad because of bad script.

But I didn’t expect it was actually REALLY BAD 

The characters dont have realistic conversation.
They just throwing ’big quotes’ on every chance they get.
Like sembang kopi nak lawan who can say the ’wokest’ thing"
Time to stop watching Syamsul’s movie. Even Mat Kilau is kind of rubbish
His movies are rubbish. You idiots are quickly impressed with Mat Kilau
"Fortunately, I have never seen that Mat Kilau movie. Will not support bad people’s business."
My colleague got it finally Tht Mat kilau is too heavy for kids.. now playing  suitable for kids and let them know our local animation movies r on par with Pixar
"Boycott the movie samsol tok. Even though I’m happy with my luck, I don’t go to the movies. Nang is the best."
"If there is a time machine, I want to take Mat Kilau to watch the movie Mat Kilau, let him fight in the theater to see how cringe the movie is."
"movie korg tu memang sampah, ramai netizen korg akui itu, sampai roman akhramovic tu ckap mat kilau xde apa apanya masuk ke pasar indo, rating rendah, di agungkan negara sendiri.

sedangkan movie indonesia masuk ke malaysia dapat rating tinggi, dpt sambutan baik."
"In terms of history and heritage, it appears that there is no promotion, whereas Pahang could have a ride on the Mat Kilau movie and sell Kg Pulau Tawar as a launch object.

Sell Ulu Cheka via Pawang Noh a less known legend. There is one Pawang Noh Gallery in Ulu Cheka which is not on the tourism map."
"There is a truth, there is a mistake in this statement. Personal is personal. But there are issues like beating people who don’t want to stay in support. Let’s see if his movie sells or not. Even though the flashy drama has started and the movie is not the best."
"Favourite Movies : Turning Red , Mat Kilau , Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 , A Werewolf Boy , All Avatar Movies , Kung Fu Hustle , Secret Zoo , Tokyo Revengers Live Action & Lagenda Budak Hostel"
"Owh you felt agitated when it come to anything about ’sentsitivities’?

I wonder where are u when non-muslim felt ’sensitive’ about ’Mat Kilau’ movie

Every race & religion have their unique sensitivities. Even those feminist movement have sensitivities."
"Some kuning likes to make plots, Raja Abdullah for example. The regiment may be a plot just like how Javanese joined Heiho during Jp occupation there, then used the combat skills to fight against imperialist.
But watching Mat Kilau movie followed by Lt.Adnan movie is just weird."
"I looked at tiktok and suddenly came out after the syamsul/aaron mess. Haha, having watched syamsul’s movies, I think he’s suitable for gangsters. I was madly disappointed that day. His narration is beautiful. But oh God, his cinematography is ruined. I want to see art"
Maybe Mat Sakau the movie will win Oscar since Mat Kilau didnt.
"And I think this movie is more successful for the atmosphere of the Malay people than the Mat Kilau movie.

Historically fact, I don’t know if it is correct or not. It’s just that his old Malay vibe is still alive, for me."
"I dont think mat kilau, senario lagi and senario the movie make me less masculine. Or maybe its just your netflix secretly spreading the degenerate ideologies like lgbtq ?"
"I doubt she would be as successful as she is now even if she got full support. Malaysia’s market power is too low compare to hong Kong and Hollywood. Just look mat kilau, highest grossing but only 97 mil ringgit far cry from the most mediocre direct to cd Disney movies earning."
"Malaysian don’t deserve TSMY, just go and celebrate mat kilau movie lol"
"I think EEAAO is also a story that if fans of the Mat Kilau movie watch, they will not understand and have no interest"
"tolong bedakan sinetron dengan movie, dan malay moves better tu celah mana? faktanya movies msians masih jauh dibawah level indo, mat kilau dulu yg dibanggkan malah setara kualiti indo tahun 2010"
"Imaginur adalah movie tentang Alzheimer. Nothing much. Overhyped
sama macam Mat Kilau"
Imaginary. One of the movies I couldn’t sleep this year. It’s like the second Malay story that I didn’t sleep after dying. Maybe Beto Kusyairi’s and Diana Danielle’s acting will be right. I can’t sleep because everything is a problem and unpredictable.
"Random thought. As much as i dont like Mat Kilau, they kinda dropped the ball by not releasing any OST. People are streaming Hasrat after watching Imaginur and movie tu baru 3mil kutipan. Granted it is a good song and its my new sendu song. I just think its a missed opportunity"
hahaha I’m not sure if Malay movies are hard to watch in cinemas. You can count with your fingers haha.. I always wait for Astro to come out. I can’t see it on netflix. haha
Yes .... i think so too he is protecting his money and other assets .... his Mat Kilau movie which he directed made RM 100 million in the box office recently
"Senang je nak tahu movie tu best & ada isi ke tak. Lepas keluar wayang kau rasa nak tengok lagi sekali.  buat aku rasa mcm tu.

Mat kilau buat aku rasa nak refund duit & masa aku."
"Movie mcm ni yg patut kita sanjung, bukan mcm mat kilau"
Mat Kilau is one of the most regrettable movies I’ve ever seen.
"Congratulations, you discovered how the movie business works ? Do you want a PhD? How do you think Mat Kilau did so well at the box office? /s"
"A movie should be a movie. It’s not like a school Independence Day time video play.

Talking about Mat Kilau and all the movies similar to it."
"The film industry here wants to win an Oscar at the Academy Awards so bad but when you send a mediocre (personally IMO, really badly made) movie like Mat Kilau as a contender, I feel like there is no hope sometimes."
Compare imagination with a Mat Kilau like comparing the Avengers movie with beautiful mind
"For every ‘Mat Kilau’ movie, there is a ‘Mentega Terbang’…I say, why not?!!"
Mat Kilau. There is no historical story. Letop2 can box office. It seems that Malaysians like this type of movie
"Orang nak compare dengan Habibie & Ainun but they forgot that he was already retired by the time those movies were out. And Indonesians are mostly lebih berjiwa besar when it comes to films.

Malaysians sampai ke sudah conflicted pasal Mat Kilau"
"Some people say that Anwar’s untold story is not to be believed because there may be additions to make the story more beautiful. that’s the end of the Mat Kilau story, that’s very true. just relax They are both movies."
"The target market for this story is not just Malaysia. Production is also from Indonesia. If you want to compare it with Mat Kilau, it’s irrelevant.

That film is also Action/Drama. Not a biographical film."
no cus Mat Kilau movie was cringe
Mat kilau overated punya movie. Zaman dulu ada pulak guna word “korang”. Nasib baik mereka cakap xguna word “mat” kalau xnampak bodo cita tu
I watched mat kilau at the movies and that one sucked ass. Was playing with my phone the whole time. But imaginur is good not bcs it stands out from the other local movies. It genuinely has a good storyline and cinematography. It deserves a praise. Of course it’s not perfect
"if you want to compare with random Malaysian movies:

Sa Balik Baju is far and away the best
Bunohan is far and away the best
Chow Kit is the best
KL Gangster is far and away the best
Mat Kilau not sure
Istanbul here i come! by far the best (peak Beto tbh)"
"Listen to the story, this movie IMAM wants to fight Mat Kilau’s narrative. But with many comments, people say the quality is far from heaven and earth (Mat Kilau more power)

So, you have to look it up to know the truth"
"Just watched Mat Kilau and Airforce The Movie. The movie that was hype before this. Yes, I’d rather watch a movie/drama late than follow the hype. For me, who studied martial arts and was a palapes tudm officer and also a fan of the action genre, I enjoy every single moment of the movies."
Why is it that Imaginur’s story doesn’t get Mat Kilau’s response? Malaysians like movies that are simple and don’t have to think a lot right?
"This Imaginur movie should have received a warmer reception than Mat Kilau.

But that’s it, this kind of movie choice won’t be very well received. Mat salleh is the same, the power movie that won the oscar, where do people see it?

If you appreciate art, I really recommend Imaginur."
They allowed all those twisted stories/narratives to scare ppl using racial lines and this is the consequence. Eg Mat Kilau Movie
"I like the Mechamato series too and don’t like the Mat Kilau movie. Trust my review, it’s the best"
"Malay:
some random Hooligan: Why don’t Malays protect their own culture and throw it away for the sake of religion?

Malay: make a Mat Kilau film mat, make it an effort to preserve culture

Hooligans: FASCIST, RACIST, FACIST FACIST, RACIST RACIST"
"OK, exchange, if the movie Mat Kilau, if it’s a Taylor Swift song, if it’s a book, I’ll make Upin Ipin SRS SRS. I’ll come to je Opet Pasipaka Sipakapaka Pasi"
"I like the hype for wahid/beto after mat kilau movie, macam bulan bintang and pakmat western did"
"When he said the Mat Kilau is 5/5, I can use it, he has a rating. Rocking movies can also be given 5/5 dehek."
"Who likes the movie Mat Kilau, our movie tastes are not the same. Even the tallest one is 5/10. The script is messy, the plot is lame, the story line is too much, the actors are the best. The acting is solid, it’s a pity that it’s like that."
i vividly remember when he rated mat kilau 10/10 and that movie turns out to be a disgrace to the society
"Aisy: Aisy has seen Air Force The Movie, but Mat Kilau died"
"When your friend just noticed you do martial arts. Remember I’m the influence of Mat Kilau . Even though it’s only been 6 years of martial arts, it’s not the influence of the movie mat kilau."
"Yea, just realised the movie is called Mat Kilau, not Nayak."
Beto stole the movie more than Mat Kilau himself
"From wanting to watch horror movie, to mat kilau then end up with dilwale."
"It beats crtically acclaimed PASKAL: The Movie which had RM30.08 million of box office but fell short behind Mat Kilau: Kebangkitan Pahlawan at RM97 million.

Then again, wiv that much of collection, the RMAF could have 7 EC-120B or 7 Bayraktar or 2 TAI Anka"
"Weiii hahaha I like to watch Mat Kilau movies but I don’t even agree with this shadow cabinet you, don’t do that. I still support this unity government. Tired of self-centered politics."
"It seems that many Malays would like it if there were no Chinese/Indians in the government. If you don’t believe it, you can go into the village or ask people who like to watch Mat Kilau movies. Most of them like that the government is 100% Malay, but they don’t want to admit to being racist. It is said to dignify the nation."
better than Mat Kilau propaganda movie
"Watching mat kilau for the very first time on netflix. Man.. it is shitty, but in a sense it is entertaining.

Macam kita tonton drama melayu pukul 7. We enjoy bashing on the absurdity.

In a sense its like watching a b movie for the heckin fun of it.

Shit movie anyways"
"Done watching Air Force the movie, sis cried when Adnan died.. sobs.. this is the best story.. compared to Mat Kilau, I feel a lot different from this Air Force, Mat Kilau is normal, this Air Force made me neves, crying, angry and scared.."
"10. TGV: Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness (Standard) 6/10
11. TGV: Mat Kilau (Standard) 9/10
12. TGV: Minions: The Rise of Gru (Family Friendly) 8/10
13. TGV: Air Force The Movie: Selagi Bernyawa (Standard) 4/10
14. TGV: Abang Long Fadil 3 (Standard) 9/10"
"Each time there is an intense scene, it feels like torture, it feels like your brain is shaking like you don’t see mv Mat Kilau, but this is literally brain shaking! I can’t wait for the movie to end."
Just watched airforce the movie for 1 minute on netflix. The cameraman makes the skill of shaking like a Mat Kilau. Don’t look at it. Fear of dizziness
"Btw, I rarely like Malay movies (except the scenario of zombies, bananas, razors, lipstick goals, cun, surrender, eh, I like it too lol) ok, I don’t like it. But I saw thick bikerz 2 and I got hooked until the end. His fighting scene doesn’t hurt his ears"
"Although FINAS does not update the quotes on the website, here I share that Air Force is the 6th best-selling movie behind Agent Ali: The Movie (RM 30.05m), Mechamato The Movie (RM35m), Hantu Kak Limah (RM 36.23 j), Munafik 2 (RM48j) & Mat Kilau (RM 97 j).

2/3"
"Basically, the quality of the mat film is bad, just look at the reviews on film forums. If the quality is bad, the Indonesian market will obviously ignore it... pfft"
This local Air Force movie that’s now on Netflix is a pile of jingoistic nonsense. 0/10 do not recommend. Also one of those Mat Kilau dudes is in it.
"Uh, none.

I’m not really into my local movie scene, bro. Although of late I see a lotta films coming out.

Weird thing the biggest show was Mat Kilau which many panned for its supremacist theme lol"
"Mat kilau could have been better that said is a damn good movie la , its like braveheart effect after watching it you will hate the colonials all .its not for everyone. I think the best movies so far ive watched recently was goodwill hunting on netflix."
"So, what do you think of Mat Kilau movie?"
"Bro, I’m not wrong, right? Ha ha. I mean the movie will blame Mat Kilau if the movie flops"
I remember the story of Mat Kilau... I started a verbal war cursing the non-Malays... the non-Malays didn’t watch the movie... I don’t like this behavior
I didn’t agree with the values and morals of Mat Kilau (the movie ah) and it’s creator. So what did I do? I didn’t watch it.
"Wanting to be a person who goes against the grain and get the support of many people is not an easy task. The analogy is watching movies like Mat Kilau, Phi Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani and even the PKR struggle circa 1998."
"""if you don’t like it don’t watch it"" - guy who wrote a 50-tweet thread about why the mat kilau movie is problematic"
"What do I want to say how ugly and hypocritical is the attitude of all of these tribes? Then it was said that the movie Mat Kilau was racist that day. If you follow the logic, if you don’t like it, you don’t have to watch it."
"Is there no other argument? It’s clear that the movie is only shown on netflix, not in the cinema Try hard, it’s really annoying. Call your Mat Kilau and tell him to defend"
"It’s strange that boys and young people can watch violent movies like Mat Kilau, but they can’t watch soft porn movies."
It’s good that the story is broken at the box office. I don’t see the younger brother wearing a girl’s cloth in the movie
"Since I don’t watch Malay movies at the cinema except for Syukur 21 & Mat Kilau, this one is easily be let go, & be gone"
srsly mat kilau is a great movie? I still like to see mamat khalid have a movie.. speaking fluently is like learning history
Mat kilau was a fucking propaganda movie and they allowed that
Mat kilau was a fucking propaganda film….all this mf calling out to ban this movie due to having “sexy” scenes are the same guys that wack off to ms puyii’s OF
All the gangster movies can la…mat kilau was basically a propaganda movie and they fucking allowed that but this cannot…smh
"Hahaha yg komplen byk2 tu takde kot nak gi tgk filem2 Melayu di pawagam.

They only watched Mat Kilau movie...maybe."
"Kecoh timeline pasal  the Movie. Oh well, what to say... our movies are full of shit, including the much-acclaimed Mat Kilau."
"You know what I find ironic about this bashing on that Pulau movie being too ’soft porn’ and calling for censorship, yet I cringe when they were ayyy okay with disgusting scene in Mat Kilau where they picture the British army being violent and stomping on pregnant lady."
what’s going on in this movie? Do you remember that there is only 1 genre of movies like Mat Kilau? make a story about hackers with more power than this softporn movie. those who do it are not Malays like me. that makes Malays have religion
"If it is made for Malays like you. Address x is malaysian film forever. If you enter Indonesia, you will be cursed only by the people there. But that’s the level of Malay movies"
did anyone complain about paskal and mat kilau? those 2 movies are great level movies. people just feel annoy by too much sexual attraction in this movie rather than horror.
"Mat Kilau tu pon see the trailer first go to play pum pang wuu movie best, come out the full citer notde la elok mana pon, stop stifling freedom in artistic expression ie film making, don’t let me say finas barai, come pon sama je barai value doesn’t run far from finas"
the qrts saying that it’s gonna be better than mat kilau when both movies are ass
"Thanks for describing Mat Kilau yet it is the highest grossed movie in malaysia, kinda sums up mly pipol punya level of wisdom."
Is this another Mat Kilau kinda movie?
WHEN YOU MAKE A MOVIE THE Mat Kilau FLAME FOR THE MAT OF SIAM
"Never liked his movies. I’ve only seen one, Mat Kilau (only for Beto Kusyairy ) I hate it when the men keep saying ""lu gua lu gua"". It’s true that I directly trained.. All time banned from my home."
"Hey Mr. Syamsul Yusof, I just want to say that I’ve been paralyzed for 8 years and since then I liked to watch your movies, and watching all of your films especially Mat Kilau gave me the strength to get up and turn off the TV and jump out of my window, thank you."
It’s good to watch Doraemon from the point of view of this movie. That day TER saw the Mat Kilau. Regret for life. I won’t watch any more movies he makes.
"It’s like a white person said people of Malay descent won’t have equal rights in their country but applauding Mat Kilau movie.

Can you imagine that?"
Al Fatihah to Mat Kilau the OG but l’ll never watch Mat Kilau the movie.
"Bro, you see that Indonesia has movies now that are at the international level. You look at it from a different angle. It’s like a special movement that looks very acting. because it looks real. Matt Mat Kilau for me 3/5 sb like the communist idiots use weapons they can attack in the field run straight you won’t die early"
"yang pengabdi setan 2 tu..disappointed giler. video review dia masuk dalam home yt i. and dia cakap movie tu best, komen² pun semua sapot dia. bila i tengok movie tu, ughh sangat² tak 5/5 yer  pengabdi setan 1 lagi best

mat kilau pun..macam hauk je tapi 5/5"
Dah boleh stop kot bila tgk movie kena ikut citarasa dia.. Thor love and thunder pun dia kata best dan mat kilau 5/5..emm ok.
"I haven’t seen it yet, so I don’t know if it’s good or not, but I don’t think it’s necessary to mention the movie."
"Different people have different tastes. If you think the Mat Kilau is 1/5, you don’t want to force people to accept it, you have an opinion. Because if that person likes the movie, it must have a high rating. Try to celebrate other people’s opinions equally."
eimran having a mental breakdown after i told him one line from the movie mat kilau shhshshshshshhsjsjj
Don’t watch any Hollywood movies fr now on cuz there’s high chances to be cigarettes and alcohol  just stick to Mat Kilau & Disney cartoons ye

i would rather watch 10 hrs of M Daud Kilau dancing and singing than watching Mat Kilau hahaha lejuk tangga action movie
"Me joining the hype:

Never watch Mat Kilau. Even when it’s on Netflix.

Bukan sebab dia. Sebab no longer feeling the need to watch movies anymore. Dulu kaki wayang, kaki movie terbaru. Now?

I’d rather sleep."
"If Mat Kilau was a good movie and money well spent then, why would the behaviour of its director now make some change their minds?"
"Rarely watch his movie too, if not mistaken “Mat Kilau”either produced or directed by him and he’s the son of Yusof Haslam, a veteran actor in Malaysian movie industry…dare not to register marriage here? Haha,why not if it’s in accordance to syariah law and “love”"
I can never understand people who liked Mat Kilau (the movie)... like... it’s overall bad
The movie Mat Kilau but the action is more like a storyline
"My whole family didn’t see the Mat Kilau at the cinema when the movie came out. Good luck ~ netflix came out, my family didn’t watch less than half because I was bored, I almost fell asleep. Don’t know about the hype."
Movie sol today has exceeded 97 million views and has caused the ranking of mat kilau to fall to second place.
"insane and hilarious how the director of munafik And mat kilau, both very islamic centered movies, is a munafik himself"
I’m the only one who feels sorry for going to the cinema to see a Mat Kilau film. you know
"Luckily I saw Mat Kilau near the free movie website. Uh,"
"Mat Kilau is the last movie I watched, but I’ve been waiting for a long time because it’s the best actor, but the director is sorry."
"rasa bersyukur gila tak tengok movie mat kilau weh, tak support si bodo"
Mechamato please beat Mat Kilau’s record that movie don’t deserve the hype
"Clearly the situation here, he did not make an initial statement, as his new movie has just been launched, it lacks luster. Lps launch is proud of millions of collections. When the situation subsides, the luster of the vibe is gone, he dares to show up to make a statement about his wife."
I’m glad I dont watch that mat kilau movie.
I don’t really care about his gender. Those who don’t know how to understand the crazy Mat Kilau movie can’t get a collection of 80 million. Air Force The Movie is 10x better than Mat Kilau
"To syamsul yusoff, i would like to say your mat kilau movie is suck and same as you. And to kaza’s family your whole fam is disgusting"
"This film is also the best, from mat moto to mat gangster to mat hypocrite to mat khurafat to Mat Kilau, finally mat marries again..."
"Saya bangga sbb tak tgk movie Mat Kilau. tak kira la tu hal kerja dia, takde kena mengena dgn personal life pun. duit dia nnt dpt ke perempuan simpanan, yelaaa kerja dia kan menghabiskan duit suami org."
Sorry if women’s emotions are disturbed but definitely no more Sol’s movie in my list. Even Mat Kilau I don’t see anymore. I do not know. Don’t do that to your wife. May you be happy.
"but when it’s confirmed that syamsul is polygamous, this is the time for daughter sarah to file and scrape all the marital property, all the support. the latest movie he died Mat Kilau millions, isn’t it income? rich auto baby! If I don’t want to spend the night, I don’t care! take the rest of my trash. haha!"
The admin is really stupid. There is no enthusiasm at all. I’m just tired of making the movie
"12. Dragon Ball Super
13. The Assistant
14. Mat Kilau
15. Batman (2022)
16. Air Force Movie"
"Praising the movie Mat Kilau like black people praising black panther, but last-last doc simp close to mat salleh too"
"My bottom 3 movies of 2022:
1. Thor: Love & Thunder
2. Mat Kilau
3. Black Adam"
"as far as upin ipin is concerned for huge influence, it’s different if your movies, dramas or songs etc can be hyped directly here, that’s the big influence. This Mat Kilau is really hyped there and here, no one sees it. not to mention other movies. where does it go?"
"""there’s just"" doesn’t mean many bro :)
the upin ipin, the boboiboy is okay to accept, but the others I doubt
It doesn’t balance if you try to compare with influences from soap operas, movies, songs etc from Indo
The lack of hype in Msia doesn’t work here, not to mention other movies hahaha"
"yea they should instead have a ringkasan where u vouch for uh, top gun remake as a good movie over mat kilau and call prc human beings bio bombs in a climate of mounting sinophobia lol"
I think Didi And Friends the movie will beat this Mat Kilau. Hahaha hooray hooray
"Baru lepas tgk movie J2: J Retribusi. Best,good storyline and action. Good quality for Malaysia standard. Much better than Mat Kilau."
"1. Jjk movie
2. Bungou stray dogs: dead apple
3. mat kilau 
4. Air force
5.idk"
"first time tgk Mat Kilau. 3 minutes in and I’m already sakit hati. Yes it’s fictional movie, but using indonesian as org bawahan British is so fucking funny lol"
"It’s no wonder that some people say that comeback concerts that last 30 minutes are the best.

Some people are ready to say that Mat Kilau is the best Malaysian Movie.

Crazy."
also just remembered this was the very last movie i’ve watched in the cinema before mat kilau lol
"I don’t really like watching mat kilau movies, it’s like listening to lectures... but hey.. it’s okay for people to make any movie as long as they have an audience and they’re making profit.. there are many other mat salleh movies that don’t know what to do and don’t get in the mind is still stubborn, he is a person"
"Still haven’t watched Mat Kilau.
The passion for the costume and the true intention of the movie being published will never go away.

It’s a mistake, I didn’t see when."
"Cte air force the movie while it’s alive, it’s wayy better than that overhyped Mat Kilau"
"Gotta list all of my favourite movies of 2022 so far:

1) MechaMato Movie
2) Minions: The Rise of Gru
3) Beavis and Butthead Do The Universe
4) Mat Kilau
5) Turning Red"
This recording artist works on film Mat Kilau which are unlucky
"movie mat kilau quality memang totally out dan hauk, baik dari segi sound mahupun kerja kamera dua dua out, best sebab it’s a historical movie je other than that hmm"
he’s been a flop the mat kilau movie was not even a good representation
Literally why me and my mom boycotts all of his movies including munafik and mat kilau lol
"Later, when you go to netflix, the first one to look away is to comment, it’s normal, this movie is blah blah blah, it’s like a dull movie back in the day"
"That day I just saw Qodrat. It’s not the best, even if you already know the story line, it’s like copying and pasting the story of Munafik, but it’s ok. Indon has more interesting movies now. The important thing is that the camera is not dull like a Mat Kilau. Uh hahaha"
I’m kind of unable to elaborate a lot of Mat Kilau movies
"When the Mat Kilau is a little opposite, there is no movie from outside. So easy to win too. You can’t have fun not wanting an opponent from outside."
There is no descendant of meleis dajjal in the Indonesian government btw meleis music on spotify indon also when will it enter the top 50????? When will the movie meleis go forward? Movie mat kilau like the controversy wkwk that’s at least 1 and cringeyyyyyyy
Because this mechamato movie doesn’t get vibes like Mat Kilau. come on support the great local animation!
No one wants to do a review of the mechamato movie. Kammon laaa kamonnn laaaaa
"Pegiweiii.. it’s so amazing that Malaysia can make animation details like that. The plot is normal.. because it’s like a pinch of Marvel, a bit of DC, a bit of Kingsman, a bit of Mat Kilau. If you are interested in watching this, you can immediately spot this scene from the movie.. liddat."
I never want to agree with the rating of the movie review mom. The Mat Kilau is rubbish. A movie that is not worth it for you to watch many times. Somehow he is still hot with people who disagree with him
It’s normal to be influenced by Mat Kilau film. That’s what he’s very proud of
Mat Kilau bukanlah movie IQ rendah. Cuma.. (isi tempat kosong).
Ajak tgk Mechamato tapi ungkit situasi movie Mat Kilau. Dan datanglah tweet2 fans dan haters condemn taste masing2 dan sumpah menyumpah.
"Month 8?? Oh my God, isn’t it the mass of us in the era of the Malay party that turned away from Islam, the best movie until the people of Kelantan watched it in Terengganu?

If that’s the time to end the wushu player’s service, that’s okay"
"Actually, you don’t even have to wait for the ""movie reviewer"" to review the movie for you to see that one story. Reviewers have their own biases. Movie rating is actually personal for raters. What that person likes is not necessarily what you like. But Mat Kilau is not the best (i’ve never watched it)"
"But that’s his review, so I like what he wants to say about the movie. As far as I can see, Zhaf doesn’t really agree with the Mat Kilau, but at the end of the day, it’s everyone’s opinion, so accept it, even if he wants to say 5 star mat Mat Kilau."
Yes tapi situasi dua movie ni agak lain. Mat Kilau viral sbb ada kait sejarah maka ramai bijak pandai amik port sebab byk boleh bincang (juga sebab SY). Mechamato tak banyak benda nak bincang untuk viral mcm MK selain ia produk Monsta yg berjaya ngan BBB.
What’s the fuss about this film? Just accept that the Mat Kilau in the middle of the film isn’t difficult
How many times has this store installed the movie Mat Kilau other customers told to play it I just don’t watch it anymore.
"When you have mentioned 2 movies, why is one movie about noisy people and one movie about people who are not noisy. That’s a comparison. It has to be realistic before comparing the elements in the movie. Mat Kilau is a historical fiction movie and Mechamato is an animated movie"
"""Hawa likes the History Subject after watching the Movie Mat Kilau""..
""Hajar likes history and mom tells stories #AnwarIbrahimPM10 since the 80s""

Do you want to teach your children to like Math?

#AnwarIbrahimPM10"
"If you want to fight the Mat Kilau, you have to bring a school group haha. Mat kilau got a lot of quotes because many groups came.

Hope agent ali movie 2 can be more than rm50 million later."
"#Mechamato the film is the MUST WATCH film in 2022. Seriously, it’s not fake. Even adults laugh in the wayang. Please lose to Mat Kilau guys. #mechanize !"
i know some fans kept saying its fictional and not meant to be historically accurate THEN WHY EVEN MAKE A MAT KILAU MOVIE
"Mano who turned away from the ""support local"" fighters at the time, if you don’t watch this mechamato movie, I’ll pull your hair out."
"I just hope that their decision to vote PN is not based on Mat Kilau movie 

Race and religion are two easy ways to use to influence people especially the young. 

Could also be that these voters are people who reject corruptors in BN, “communist” in DAP.

PN = last option."
"7. The fighting scene in this movie highlights the art of martial arts. I like & admire the way the publisher works the elements of martial arts in a modern and epic framework. If the film Mat Kilau showcases traditional martial arts, then this film is the modern version of Mat Kilau."
Imagine if the mechamato movie came out at the same time as the Mat Kilau story. The power tho!! There are more and more people who are climbing up the hill and fighting like martial arts!
"The promise of serving the devil, all the movies are Mat Kilau .. But yaya I also wear specs.. I’m afraid that my eyes will look different.. I’m afraid that I want to shareee hmmm"
"Mat kilau dilakon, chin peng didukung, si kitol digendung. Tajuk movie baru. Ok tak?"
"Remember the people who complained about the Mat Kilau movie fighting scene. I got slapped but the sound effect is like shit. Hello? Have you never seen a Tamil/Hindustan versus Tamil/Hindustan movie?? The best coat!! The sound goes first before the fist arrives. Please, I want to complete Mat Kilau"
You know how distasteful local movie industry is when Adi Putra (from Mat Kilau) wins best actor award at FFM.
"Thought it’s gonna be Mat Kilau vs. Airforce The Movie head to head tonight, but Small Town Heroes and Spilt Gravy are the real deal!"
This cabinet minister is worse than Mat Kilau movie
"Yeah, maybe exh Van Gogh’s is what you say suck.

Just like the movie Mat Kilau korg said the best.

Which is...taste korg. Junk or Diamonds. Your happiness is your money."
This movie should be the last source of reference. We will not get a picture of Mat Kilau if we watch the Mat Kilau movie.
"Same, I also criticize this film. Even in the 2000s, movies were still bad

Are there any good films of yours? I’ve never watched it, watching Matt Sparkle makes it look like an old soap opera"
Is this some kinda dialogue from mat kilau movie......same old rethoric been recycling for decades
"Lol im just telling from a different perspective, for example mat kilau - how accurate is it? Or even hollywood movie black hawk down.. im not saying ur wrong, its just different perspectives."
"Kilau would hv been a wonderful movie with a correct historical narrative if the film producer, director & writer didn’t throw minorities under the bus to sell an agenda"
Goodnight Tweepies!...I’m tired and going to watch a movie called MAT KILAU ..2022..on Netflix.have a good night and see you tomorrow.
"If you’re a Malay, go see it, all Malaysians will see this movie later"
any film should beat mat kilau lah... most overrated movie ever. and i’m a superconservative malay.
"Mat Kilau the most overrated movie ever in Malaysia. The most annoying for me is the sound effect plus the camera goncang. Gempa bumi kah masa shooting? Sound effect tu bah, pny tidak realistic. Mau tiru Ip Man tp x jadi. Oops"
Learn history from the movie Mat Kilau? Almost everything in the movie is factually wrong and messed up. Its a fictional movie btw. It’s when you sleep during History class that’s why you don’t even understand the federal constitution
Look at the Mat Kilau movie ka ..?? Tya jak ..!!
"Many diss movie Mat Kilau. I don’t think it’s necessary, unless it’s going to be critical in terms of film.

Let’s celebrate our local film talent."
IF THAT ANWAR MOVIE COMES OUT PLEASE MAKE IT BEAT MAT KILAU IN SALES FFS
"Don’t provoke, but people who have turned away from religion and the PN race will never stop questioning the election of the Malay Muslim King and Agong, his supporters are still a little bit post quote movie mat kilau. You want to say that the Agong sold the religion and the nation on Malay land himself to the bai"
This movie I will go watch!! Mat Kilau can now be saved in the archive. Not relevant at all!
"He is fighting for Malay supremacy and the position of Islam (this is what PN supporters say). Anwar supports LGBT and interferes with Malay rights (according to them).

Follow the spirit of Mat Kilau from the movie (reference to PN members), FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT"
Source dia movie Mat Kilau
"On tiktok, there is a video showing the flag, but the audio of Adi Putera is in the Mat Kilau movie. Those who agree with the video, do you still want to live in the same place?"
Forgive me too @zhafblock. Unblock me. I promise not to curse your movie taste. But is it true that Mat Kilau is the best?
Londeh don’t not londeh. It’s fun to see Malays arguing with each other. Like watching the movie Mat Kilau vs Hang Tuah. Other nations just applaud. Londeh while eating lodeh with impit rice
"I don’t know why, I miss Yasmin Ahmad and her film. Detoxing myself with her movie after just a brief moment with Mat Kilau. We need an inclusive story that showing true Malaysian spirit and mosaic culture."
"<--- just got in the mood to get angry at the paid tiktok boy who allegedly ""watched the movie many times but voted ph"". That movie sucks."
People who were overhyped over Mat Kilau (movie) are just as stupid as the Brits (& rest of the world) who believe The Crown was treated as a documentary.
"Good story, the Mat Kilau movie is not historically correct. And then make the Malays feel inferior to other people."
"when mat kilau first came out: BEST. MAKE MORE LOCAL MOVIES LIKE THIS. SEMANGAT MELAYU. GET IT TO 100M

after mat kilau came out on netflix: tak best pun movie ni. tak ikut fakta"
"Tbh, I have never seen the full Mat Kilau movie. Only a quarter of the movie, so I don’t know what made Brade tiktok show the sword in the frame."
Yusuf Azmi is one of the most wretched and bastard human beings. mat kilau is a shitty propaganda movie. Hadi Awang should be thrown into prison.
"I don’t like Mat Kilau movies, it’s not because of the racism issue.. But the movie is really not the best. The first 10 minutes I didn’t feel like leaving the stage"
"Wei, kasi tangkap Muyi and others, also the Mat Kilau movie director. Pasal dia org la this is all happening. 
Arrst them under Akta Hasutan."
"This PN boy can send the Mat Kilau video to Abah who went viral on tiktok saying that he is Malay and has never been united, why do you want to link to another movie??!!"
"Mat Kilau is the one to blame . If it’s true that the movie is probs, supposedly the issue has arisen for a long time right after it was shown. Even after it was shown at the cinema, it received millions of collections, and it’s already on netflix. It has nothing to do with it"
The one who chatted and looked at this Mat Kilau made me feel bad. Have you read the history of that Mat Kilau apart from movies?
To make a good movie is not actually by stating all facts but to put a little bit of fiction. It is called entertainment miss. If it is a documentary yes it will be all fact. There are a lot of lessons learn in the movie mat kilau. Take it positive and learn from mistakes.
"Just watched the movie Mat Kilau once, I’m already a warrior of the country, defender of religion. If I show a picture of the actual Mat Kilau and how he is, other people will believe it.

Sad."
"That movie, Mat Kilau, stirred some real problems. Factually so wrong yet so dangerous. It should be banned and it’s producers fined for such blatant disregard for facts."
"Real Deadly Violence is not like the movies, kids. 
It’s not Mat Kilau, Bond or Superheroes.
Don’t play with the idea. Ever."
"I am not suggesting any party to be corrupted. I’m saying that sometimes it is wise to keep quiet when we are uncertain. Not to mislead, create fitnah, and create this separation between us just like the sayings of your so loved Mat Kilau movie"
Finas is also one. Can you approve racist content like the movie Mat Kilau. Do you want to practice? The KKN kissing scene in the Dancer Village is said to be unethical. Apo. Your mouth doesn’t burn if we say fire. Sad
"The fact that these boys are spreading video snippets from the movie Mat Kilau isn’t it a racial issue? when people are educated about the movement with MCA, they suddenly spin and say it’s not a racial issue. some of you guys are just racists and enablers and it shows"
Is it not enough to deal with the Mat Kilau film issue?
tiga janda did more for the malay movie industry than whatever mat kilau did lol
"this is not talking about the real mat kilau btw, he was a real hero. the movie is still dogshit"
the movie itself tarnished mat kilau’s legacy
"Haven’t seen the movie mat kilau, which I suspect is a propaganda film sponsored by pple with hidden agendas. Our youths r not politically aware maybe? If yes, it would be a narrow shallow pov.  They’re looking for excitement?"
"honestly, I’ve never seen Mat Kilau’s story ahhaha, so I’m clueless as to what this tiktok boy is talking about in the Mat Kilau movie"
"I hate those ppl r like ""mat kilau x best"" ""camera goyang ii"" if ur that professional, why dont jer yg tolong rakam kn movie tu? Also if u dont like the movie u dont hav to tell ppl laa...thats ur opinion why sibuk nk tell other ppl?"
"I don’t see Mat Kilau is a racist movie. Kalau belajar sejarah betul2, tentu dh tahu. Young generation this days really don’t seem to ’research’ it rather than saying ’OMG THIS MOVIE IS RACIST. DON’T WATCH OK??’."
"The movie Mat Kilau, it’s wrong, but those kids who are over are better"
Movie luster
"still ppl are not focusing on how racist that movie is , pn supporters are using mat kilau the movie as an alasan to vote for abah  literally most of the ppl who mentioned about mat kilau are rempits high schoolers"
Is it me or does it seem like a lot of the pro-PN racist Malays keep quoting the Mat Kilau movie as an example of why they should reject PH?
"At this point, I think Malaysia’s 10th Prime Minister is gonna be Mat Kilau The Movie."
"You know what.

I’m tired..
You complain about Malay movies x variety.. when there are historical movies like Tanda Putera Mat Kilau, you are busy trying to ban them..

If this is the case, the country’s film industry wants to grow.

I’m tired of seeing stupid jokes with forced marriage quotes.."
The only good thing to come out of that Mat Kilau movie was that Ricky Gervais goreng kunyit joke
"Ok, when is the anwar ibrahim movie coming out? If the movie is ready in time for him to become PM, it must be a blockbuster. Maybe you can fight Mat Kilau?"
Can you tell me the movie facts that go along with the real Mat Kilau chronology?
Next time don’t make ah movie cam Mat Kilau if the only result is malays being more racist zzz
"My father was also angry about the film Mat Sparkle.

p/s: he has seen that movie. so he can criticize all he wants"
"Luckily this is the only Malaysian movie that came out. If there are 10 movies, how can the tiktok boy get tired of typing?"
"Well, that’s all I want to do with this Mat Kilau movie. There are no ports in the country"
"Yes, it’s wrong, if people campaign in a healthy way and don’t raise religious sentiments, wouldn’t young people be so influenced that they want to say that people don’t like Mat Kilau movies, right? People who are blind to the history of people who know the movie don’t Mat Kilau"
Repeat after me: Mat Kilau is NOT a historical movie that should be shown to young children who is not exposed or made understood of the unity of multicultural community in Malaysia prior to that.
"Because of Mat Kilau’s story, do you have Malay blood? Lanciao, if the movie doesn’t come out, it would be nice before this multi-racial hiduo. Merdeka has been free for decades"
Korang kalau tak keluar movie mat kilau tu ntah2 mat kilau pun tak pernah dengar. Pastu duk jaja muka adi putra tu for what? Kemon beb.
I would also like to point out and reiterate AGAIN on how the MAT KILAU movie is a massive influence in giving a voice and inspire extremism and provoke racial sentiments in our nation.
mat kilau was a god damn dangerous movie to release before elections
"mat kilau is a real character, the events at sungai pahang happened. you want to question the dialogues, some added characters in the movie go ahead but the core of it is true.

yes, our forefathers did fight penjajah demi bangsa dan agama. tanya atuk nenek kau pun tau lah."
“semangat mat kilau!!” they had ONE song playing the entire movie and its best described as Epic Background Music pls dont get any idea from that movie
tak boleh nak salahkan movie mat kilau tbh. bc it’s relevant to that point of time. malays were really struggling back then. don’t nitpick history for your own narrative
"I have a Mat Kilau movie bid, please. The first 10 minutes are off again. Waste time."
"Chat against people who watch Mat Kilau but vote for PH. Mat Kilau is against the colonialists. Ah fool! Even then, you know Mat Kilau from the movie, you don’t study history in detail."
Mat Kilau you mean the sh movie not based on fact more like made up bs?
"If you say that you don’t see the Mat Kilau film, you won’t be convinced anymore"
"when people say that Mat Kilau film brings a bad message, you don’t believe it, so watch it now"
"My take is Mat Kilau is a fiction. I don’t care. They can put Mat Kilau riding a unicorn wearing a Superman shirt with the background of the BTS song against the Nazis, for all I care. Its a shit movie though."
Dia terpaling movie mat kilau? Hmm
"Watch the Mat Kilau movie. When arguing, follow the DAP slang."
"HAHAHAHAH damn, I’m willing to go and pm instead of looking back. Ban the wayang, at least that kind of movie is not coming out anymore"
"* supporters bringing up the mat kilau movie as a point in argument over why PH shouldn’t win as though that whole movie wasn’t about micro aggression & subtle racism + stereotyping towards other races in this country, them:"
the isley malay pls is guided by the madinah charter not that Mat Kilau film pls look at the social justice rasulullah how to do
"When there is a movie coming out, there are a lot of people like that, haha"
"Movies like Mat Kilau shown to younger audiences (below 18) should be prohibited, when you are not mentally able to make sound decisions, we could see a bunch of hooligans running around stabbing and chopping people"
"That’s what makes me angry. Talk about history because you learn from TikTok, as far as watching Mat Kilau movies while at school you are sleeping during history class"
ngl but this generation has some weird obsession with that mat kilau movie and they just want to follow the trend. Not the movie’s fault. Tapi budak skang memang asalkan ada benda nak jadikan content
"Should have seen it coming when we saw reactions to that Mat Kilau movie, shouldn’t we?"
"For a fact, I watched mat kilau and it’s a very good movie! Definitely not to be applied in politics"
That’s why I dislike Mat Kilau movie and its obsessed fans.
"Try it, if Syamsul Yusuf didn’t make that movie, you wouldn’t even know him. Try to make PH people amazed skit with information that many people don’t even know to incite. It’s not even a kindergarten thing, butoh. I’m old enough, Savage is good enough to compare with the movie. Butoh"
"But the Mat Kilau story is really funny, I just watched it. It’s like 10 times I’ve been amused by this Mat Kilau movie"
That stupid Mat Kilau movie didn’t help either.. it’s basically our version of The Birth of a Nation urgh only instead of KKK we have racist tiktok.
This is all the fault of the Mat Kilau movie
"It’s funny to see that this boy is the most Mat Kilau, even the Mat Kilau movie makes my neck swell, not to mention this boy"
"To be honest, i rather watch Rise: Ini Kali Lah on repeat than that rubbish movie Mat Kilau."
"Fuck movie Mat Kilau, it should be during the general election that day to filter who says that MK movie is the best, send it back."
"When we said Mat Kilau was a bad movie because it’s factually incorrect, ramai Malays offended. 

But now, tengoklah, ramai budak muda dekat Tiktok terpengaruh and jadikan that movie as an inspiration of whomst to vote? And to re-ignite 13th May? What are we teaching our kids?"
And for all young blood yang so affected by Mat kilau do your search better kids. Jangan gunakan 2 hours movie that contain more fiction than fact as your reference.
I have already said that the tiktok boy and mat kilau the movie are not separated
Load of crap show thru Tanda Putera n Mat Kilau movie. This is the result.
"This is the blood of the heroes, see this movie defend the leadership of the scholars hmmm, attitude reflects who we are, don’t blame DAP, it’s already behaved like an ape, it’s belacan"
"Mat Kilau this Mat Kilau that , bffr lah that movie is fiction . Why can’t we be kind to each other without creating any racial or religious fight ? I’m so worried like I don’t understand why people want to fight and use unnecessary violence. Please we are all the same."
After watching the movie mat kilau continue to look at the true malay fighters of those tiktok boys. What?
It has not been the case that our Malays are so busy updating about the Mat Kilau movie movie.
Movie Mat Kilau was a mistake
Everyday I’m seeing more reasons why this mat kilau movie was a terrible idea
"The previous ruling Govt should also be blamed. They shouldve banned Mat Kilau(movie),which is in no way historically accurate & glorifies racial separation while portraying one race as superior & dominant. The makers should be fined heavily for trying to incite race based hatred"
"I didn’t watch the movie mat kilau trailer, I didn’t watch it at all, so I don’t know what it is about the movie mat kilau. I only know about Mat Kilau when I was studying at school"
"Even if there is a movie with a Mat Kilau, that’s definitely a character who comes back over and over again. Because you don’t even know history yourself, right? Just say which one is there as long as it looks like it is there"
"Seriously, people are surprised that Malaysia is full of fascists. Mat Kilau is openly artless, ahistorical fascist propaganda, and it is the highest grossing Malaysian film by a large margin. Why are you surprised?"
"Siapa yg suatu masa dulu cakap bahawa filem mat kilau hanya movie, tengok bagaimana impak sekarang dan di pakai sebagai contoh."
That’s why I said before that Mat Kilau movies are just entertainment. What the hell is using Mat Kilau film to vote for this shit hahaha
"Who has seen Mat Kilau that many times? Look at it once, you’re sick of looking at it again. Focus on other movies. Go to National Geographic, can you know that the world is wide, not only Malays are sitting in this world."
that mat kilau movie should have never been made. especially by syamsul yusof
"Next time watching the movie once is enough. The 3-4 times you look at the Mat Kilau, it’s really your brain shot my brother’s son is also dizzy BN is falling, and you’re making him dizzy."
"I saw a tiktok say ""yang undi ph tu boleh tengok balik filem mat kilau kot""

BRO THAT MOVIE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE LMFAOOO"
Tiba tiba aku rasa macam nak salahkan Syamsul Yusof arah movie Mat Kilau bila tengok Tiktok budak muda pasal 13 May ni
"""watch the Mat Kilau many times"" joke on you I despise the movie with my whole heart bc the lack of proper planning, know to attack and want to fight but it seems that’s how Malay is"
What’s so incriminating in Mat Kilau movie pls can someone let me know? I tak lepas tengok 15mins pun..
"guys, I’m sorry, sis, I don’t understand because I haven’t seen the Mat Kilau movie anymore"
"But there is a movie reviewer who supports Mat Kilau and then gets angry when people dispute his judgment, he has other backups like"
"ye weh, pn supporters kat ws status all quote mat sparkles never run out, dah la movie is also historically inaccurate lmao"
"And to those who use mat kilau movie as a good example, yall should really learn history with books, not movie"
I don’t know if you watch the movie Mat Kilau and you become Malay. You are stupid because the movie is full of distorted facts. Just fiction. It’s time for History class when you fell asleep.
There is government intervention here. How bad it is. Mat Kilau and those movies alike please get banned. X brings benefits only brings disadvantages
"Regardless, betul lah movie Mat Kilau tu cause more harm. Videos pon byk mention Mat Kilau. If those kind of movie is not banned and something is not done to promote facist, bahaya la. Dia xkan jadi sekarang but the impact will be seen many years down the road"
"Now.... Movie “MAT KILAU""

WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKE.."
"I’m done with the Mat Kilau, it looks like you know that because it’s in the movie, right? It’s not wrong, that’s not what you can say. many more Malay figures who fought for the Malay nation. adooooooooiiiiii"
"who believes that this Mat Kilau movie is 100% true, it’s really cool"
Faham that this has always been an underlying problem amog malays but i still choose to be a mat kilau movie hater
I will always hate the mat kilau movie for what it did to our society
So this tiktok boy is apparently influenced by the movie Mat Kilau? Hahshahsssss
mat kilau not to the british opponent? I watched the wrong movie...
There is a negative side to this Mat Kilau film
"The TikTok video that everyone has in mind is called the film Mat Kilau. Not that character, but the film. Now tell me that movie wasn’t an effective propaganda piece. PN should give Syamsul Yusuf some kind of award."
"Kannn. It really isn’t just a movie. Yeee crazy gullible. Just looked at the Mat Kilau, suddenly Malay only je i. Their eyes. His brain"
The movie mat kilau bangang is a reference. Shit right
"In my opinion, Mat kilau makes a story that catalyzes the spirit of the warriors, Le. If it is the catalyst of the nation, aduuuu. Struggle alone.

Actually, a movie should not be made to awaken the soul of the nation."
Didn’t noe that patrotic movie like Mat Kilau diorang took it as like this.
Mat Kilau the movie pig
"It’s normal that the Malays are weak like that, the Chinese are all doing nothing, they’re shaking...they’re lost in luster...people watch historical movies to learn lessons, improve and improve, not slander the nation."
and the movie? mat kilau
Mat kilau movie was a mistake lmao
"Yesza depa forget this is the age of the internet. The age of socmed is not the age of newspapers. Things are very easy to spread and people believe. It’s true that there are good people, but it’s a big mistake to show hatred towards this Malay landlord. The movie Mat Kilau is still hot. Got it"
"History has proven the fall of the Malay land because there is no unity among us, some defected but unfortunately we never want to learn from our nation’s old mistakes. Watched the Mat Kilau movie many times but didn’t learn the lesson. Is it hard to unite?"
Haha. I’m sorry I didn’t watch Mat Shino many times because I can understand more from the book than watching the movie.
"When I saw the movie Mat Kilau, I wanted to be a hero just like the people in the 2Pac song wanted to be gangsters. Haha."
Membazir je UMNO buat movie pasal Mat Kilau
PN played racial cards more lmao. Mat Kilau’s fight apparently that no one knows until the movie came out. Then the fear they instilled on Chinese. And then what attacking Christians in a talk? Could Muuhi be anymore desperate?
"Same energy like kelantan PAS endorsing Mat Kilau movie(which is an islamofascist propaganda by isma) and tells them to go watch it as much as you can! But there is no fckig cinema in Kelantan at all!
Oh the hypocrisy 

Only endorse entertainment that advances their agendas only."
There are many kot tiktok video movie Mat Kilau
Do you think that China is a colonialist who is arguing about Mat Kilau movies? I don’t understand what the mat kilau who fought the colonialists has to do with our current issue.
fuck this country. cant make films like we want. we are gonna resort to making films like mat kilau and other military propaganda movies
i blame mat kilau movie idc
Crying over Mat kilau and visiting the Hang Tuah museum but then forget to practice the nilai murni in that movie.Islam teach us to respect human right to repect the others.Respect another religions first before they respect yours.Same goes with the perkauman issue
if i see another mat kilau movie clips….
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and mat kilau movie..
More Mat Kilau-style films?
"Since PAS has majority seats i highly doubt that they’ll just be any minister. Obviously this Hadi wants to be . Imagine... No more night clubs,no more concerts, no more Hollywood movies since semuanya ada lgbt la atheism la this la that la. Watch mat kilau je la everyday"
They are not mature enough to think. It’s just that they know how hard it is to fight movies. Xnak malay colonized
"I saw “Mat Kilau"" movie as a horse in Chess game dalam pergerakan politik ni. Memang rally sebahagian Malay.

Berapa banyak semangat ""Kemelayuan dan Islam"" dikeutamakan. And only show that other than Malays are enemies. Which it ridiculous."
"then it doesn’t run out until the Mat Kilau movie is finished. It’s not the best, it doesn’t Mat Kilaur"
"Gsc, tgv all here close now
Just look at the Mat Kilau every 2 months
In Kelantan, it’s like that. When there’s an event, watching a movie must be dull"
"Jujur cakap

“Mat Kilau"" movie success was a mistake that PH failed to recognize.

Dimomok hidup2 macam Hang Tuah, Bila kita yang tolak dilabel “Jebat"""
People quoting that English man from Mat Kilau movie for whatever is happening right now makes me cringe.................help
"“Mat Kilau"" movie

Like a large Boulder swing that PH failed to prepared.."
A special thanks to Mat Kilau as well. That movie did wonders to Malays.
"Don’t say you just enjoy looking at the Mat Kilau but don’t take any notice. Such a waste of time and money.

When the time comes, you can put into practice what was said in the Mat Kilau film, but it is not put into practice. Why? Why?"
"My aunt wants to say that she is not Muslim but she wears a hijab, she wants to say that she is full but she is old, remember, auntie, don’t be a traitor to your own religion, when you watch the movie, you will feel the identity of the Malay nation until you see it in the movie, when you are 15 everyone is stupid."
I can already imagine more movies like mael totey mat kilau will fill cinemas HAHAH
"What is your reference from the movie Mat Kilau? Wow, that’s a movie. Tang Malay is watching the movie Mat Kilau. Why don’t you take the movie reference Rempit to Abang Long Fadil to Bini-biniku Gangster? He’s dead tired."
"People didn’t believe me when I said Mat Kilau is an anti national movie advocating malay supremacy sentiments for the election.

We’ve never been more divided as a country."
not them using Mat Kilau movies as reference
Mat Kilau movie had a huge impact. It sustained a longer period in the cinemas for this to happen. As simple as that.
This is all about the film Mat Kilau
Every single person who thought Mat Kilau was a good movie voted PN.
"Idk if you guys realize this or not, but this GE15 has open my eyes about the state that are majority non-malays are voting for PH. whiles the Malays are having split votes. It remind me of Mat Kilau movie, those line about how Malay will be weaken if we are not together."
Many of the malays stay true to religion and race sentiment. Thats why Mat Kilau movie become box office although it is a meh film
so how do you campaign using Mat Kilau movie verses?
Maybe you can watch this malay movie name “ mat kilau ” it’s pretty good  ig??
"In Malaysia where Kelantanese are okay drinking mud for years, the corrupt don’t stand trial, Mat Kilau is a top movie, and we are surprised that Nurul Izzah is doing badly?"
"Why is his sentence the same as a Mat Kilau film?

."
"Tula jihoon, I’ve never met him until he wants to make Malaysia liberal. Tired of making Mat Kilau movies, Malays forget easily"
"Don’t be weird, Anthony Loke is going to go to the Mat Kilau movie just to bullshit the Malays. Dr. Daniel etc"
Don’t bash me for not looking at the Mat Kilau. I don’t even watch TV. I don’t watch any dramas or movies or netflix
"Btw, freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of consequences. PH fights for the right to speak (FoS), but that does not mean that the voice cannot be reprimanded / taken action (FoC).

Speech = Mat Kilau is the best movie ever
Consequence = Criticized for having no taste"
i just watched mat kilau bro the movie is so bad
"Right?? In terms of culture, Sume’s indigenous elements are indeed crowned as high as possible

Muslims can learn a lot from this movie

Mat Kilau too hahah"
Aku rasa movie Airforce lagi baik dari Mat Kilau. Airforce ni boleh lagilah layan dua tiga kali. Mat Kilau cukup tengok sekali je.
"Aku pernah ingat ada movie reviewer pernah bincang bab demografi Malaysia ni mempengaruhi hasil kutipan filem. Waktu tu diorang bincangkan RM 30 juta tu the most boleh dapat kalau ambik kira faktor penonton Bumi saja.

Kiranya cerita Mat Kilau tu berjaya tarik audiens non Bumi la"
"Not yetzzzz. Will be. Mat Kilau, until now I can’t finish it. There are too many feedback people. So I’ve already seen the movie"
"What do you want to do, even the name of the spirit is dull, you’ve watched a lot of movies, you don’t understand"
"That’s my opinion. Movie Mat Kilau is very cringe. But based on movies that Indonesia has released, there are indeed many masterpieces. So, you can expect the result"
How to blocked mat kilau on Netflix? But I’m gonna tell her netflix delete the movie lol
"As much as i dislike to watch mat kilau’s movie, my 4y/o daughter watched it more than 100 times i think and she knew the sequence what is going to happen next. One hilarious sentence she said it out loud was “stupid malays”. Eh anak kau tu jawa melayu tok tok k. Hihhhh."
Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix. Can last less than 15 minutes and then close. You are tired of watching this movie wkwkwk
Cringe sial movie mat kilau
All Biggie movie will face the issue go thru the banned finas all because of MAT KILAU they wanna cover up fake Box Office Report cheap mentality grow up dudes
Collab with Mydin & major brands/media outlets. Must include this value in future advertising. Make a movie for hype like Mat Kilau glitter to push the agenda to pamper the community.
"just pure arrogance

Mat Kilau movie had cemented  into the mainstream. Many Malays now feel comfortable showing their fascism"
"just saw dahmer already feeling nauseous.. not yet eid gain jd movie. I don’t see the Mat Kilau, it just fades.."
"zaman mat kilau dah masuk movie, skarang mana ada main pang5 lagi lah, the people of Gombak needs hardworking people to represent them, who can work for their benefits not just political peddlers"
oh btw i do think some movies are bad but usually i dont know how to put out a review tbh cause i wont even finish a movie once i think its boring other than the fact i rarely go to the cinema so yeah (i watched mat kilau on neftlix)
"Suspected the Mat Kilau movie was propaganda material. Didn’t watch it. Who paid the RM100 million for it? Similarly, the report on TT is elections material. Likewise, the pre-recorded message from the thief being aired on national TV. How much taxpayer’s money used?"
It’s insanely solid even though it cringes a little like Mat Klaau. But the only movie that The Rock doesn’t cringe
"Fake account? Check back, I have this account since when. X main r fake2. The court case was not settled because my boss wanted to prove that he was guilty. That’s it. Very jealous of people. How is our nation going to progress? It doesn’t look like a shelf. I don’t feel the spicy sarcasm in the movie. Thick skin"
Steady doq. There are lots of Mat Kilau references in this film
"Movies: 
Mat Kilau
Medieval 
Fall
Mother’s love
Accident man Hitmans holiday"
Watch the movie mat kilau ready to climb but become a talisman of the Mossad hurmmm
My husband really likes Mat Kilau film. He just wants to hype hahaha.
"Do you want to study Malay people using Mat Kilau film? One movie is enough to lethargy. It’s good that he cites Malays, many people who love him don’t develop a mind, it’s a little difficult for the Mossad to study Malay people. We prefer to be unpredictable"
"That’s enough 3. I just want to add that if you make the movie, please detail the narration a little. I didn’t see that the first white person came to look for people, before that people served food. It should stand out as a piece of local Pahang cake. That’s right. That’s where it is."
Mat kilau has so much good lines man cant believr im so into a malay movie lmao

GOOD LUCK THE FIGHT FOR ILLAM IS NOT A FIGHT FOR MAT GLASS UNDERSTANDING JUST A MOVIE THAT IS PAID TO BE VIEWED IN TONTO IN MALAYSIA
"Aku dengor “sape bikin movie mat kilau? Call polis, call hr. It’s alright”"
"This is why I can’t believe any Malay film critics who praise Mat Kilau because to me the story is rubbish. Trash.

It’s stories like this that make people go back to ""I don’t watch Malay movies"". Because he was appointed as the greatest, he is actually very humble.

Then u complain org x support."
Is there even a Kat Bilibili... but wtf is there a Mat Kilau for the movie Kat Bilibili wow
movie day show Mat Kilau. not interested…
"The more I think about the movie adaptation of history Mat Kilau, the worst it gets. Why the fuck did I gave it a 5? I’m changing it to a 2 because it gets worst when I think about it."
"2. Since only Whites are referred with ""Sir"" which means ""Tuan"" by most of malays nowadays, it doesn’t Mat Kilaur to say that Mat Kilau movie is totally nothing more than a useless history documentation in cinemas. They should refer them as ""mister"" (encik), no more ""Sir"" (tuan)."
"My father wanted to say that he liked the movie Mat Kilau, so once I sprayed the member in silence"
I mean okay if the movie is for good purpose. But another Mat Kilau like films? Hmmm...
Funny thing about your name is that it’s similar to my irl name. Also I heard they said they’re going to make movie that’s like Mat Kilau bcs it’s... Laku?
Fucking hell RM50M for shit movies like Mat Kilau
"Jika ingin mencari kekuatan, 
carilah Allah.

- Mat Kilau -

This is the second time my eyes throw tears when I heard this words come from that movie. Idk why but this words memang menusuk sampai ke hati

Sebagai seorang pendosa, I think this words hit me so hard"
"That’s right. You can criticize, don’t mock the people who eat. It’s just like the case of Mat Kilau film that day, it’s okay to say that the movie isn’t the best, but to say that the person who watched the movie has no taste, he’s become a different person"
"Then I sat in the living room watching TV.. at 11:30 am, my sister and I stayed in the living room because the others were already asleep.. so we decided to watch it until it was 12 o’clock.. okay our time Wait, the TV has turned off because I’m watching a movie on my phone.."
"today? You bet! Let’s go get a tix. 

And yes, not in a million years will I pay for a Mat Kilau type of local movie. That’s pure Malay supremacy propaganda, and really the movie was just badly made."
"Stop play mat kilau all time bro toldya to open high&low movie, shi literally fire and better writing no cap"
"ISMA slaves don’t make sparkling mat scripts, top 10 international most watched netflix. Best blockbuster movie in Malaysian cinema history."
Speaking of Mat Kilau. I am not an expert in this line. But this movie is overrated. Enough said.
"-Lack of character growth, or some may call ""The Hero’s Journey"". Mat Kilau and chums were pretty much OP from the start and bent on fighting the British, even getting anointed by the Malay chieftains, and so the movie just shows their exploits upon this motivation till the end."
"Mat Kilau is a good movie.

For the first time in a long time, a movie where Muslims are the protagonists."
"Husband: I don’t understand why people say Mat Kilau ni bosan.
Me: not for me, all Malay movies are membosankan for me. I pukul sama rata, don’t worry."
Tbh if Malaysian made historical movies they will be top tier like Mat Kilau. Imagine the entire seat filled with Malaysians in their traditional clothes when watching this movie
Just watch mat kilau. It’s so good . I need more malay movies with this sejarah genre.
"It’s actually a nice movie, you should try it ’Mat Kilau’."
I’m sorry I missed the bus but what’s the fuss about the movie?
"Hahaha,i think race is fine,religion we need to have vast knowledge in order to have a debate or argument over it,politics are quite tricky but if its super obvious like najib & rosmah,we should talk about it,mat kilau is average movie quality with overhype people"
"for 2022
- kkn in the dancer village
- I thought you were home
- morbius
- bullet train
- Mat Kilau
- air force the movie"
"In the last week I’ve watched Morbius (Dull), The Fullmetal Alchemist Movies (Don’t Ask), Mat Kilau (Malaysian Film), and my recommendation is Blues Brothers. Was a busy week."
"Just finished mat kilau movie.. 
Script 9/10
Cinematography 4/10
Summary its like watching 100 scene in ten second..."
"And everything you mentioned are low budget soap operas from the 90s-2000s, if they are in 2022 then it’s clearly bad because this year is better than the 90s, right, MAT KILAU appears in 2022 which already has better film editing and storyline but the question is..... :("
Finally get to watch Mat Kilau on Netflix the other day coz didn’t get to. The movie was awesome no lie. But sad to see what the future generations has becoming into. All what they hav fought for has lost
"It’s the same as Malay movies. For example, the movie Mat Kilau. The actors all have looks."
"Mat kilau movie is pretty disappointing, story n fight choreography is good, but the composition n camera is ???? Terrible"
"I don’t even know what series or movie is new at #NetflixTudum because I work mornings for a month. All I know is Mat Kilau. Last week I saw in the MRT using 1.25x speed I felt like throwing up hahaha.

I want to watch a movie tonight. Last evening there was a buy marukku so lets go!"
Just saw the half Mat Kilaute. What kind of movie is this?
perhaps the Malays will then unite if they’re colonised or ruled by others… remember the movie ‘Mat Kilau’??
Kimais I tried watching the Mat Kilau movie and I can’t get passed it after a few mins in. What a horrible presentation.
"forget mat kilau, adik samsul made a much less nauseous movie"
"Mat Kilau movie was fictional.  Not loosely based on true events. 

My advice, ignore the movie-- seek more history knowledge about Mat Kilau."
"3. MAT KILAU
It’s a story of the British colonial reign in India and how they were repelled. It is also an average movie, expect some of the Bollywood action sh*t. It’s 5.3/10 for me."
ok but am the only one who got impressed by how creative our brain is at constructing dreams? like the plot fuh impressive? better than that mat kilau movie tho i dont actually watch the it
Are you watching Mat Kilau movie in Netflix ?
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau. To finish it, it took me about a week because I looked at it little by little. Honestly, I don’t have any comments because of the fact that it’s not a typical Malay movie full of love and romance, I’m already happy lol. For the level of Malay ideals, it’s okay"
"Arrived at home when mom and dad were on a movie date with a Mat Kilau ready to close the lights, tuuu.. feeling like that at the cinema"
mat kilau this mat kilau that why noone ever mention HOW SCARY THE MOVIE IS CANT BELIEVE ITS PG13 EVERYONE DIEDIEDIE
"Movie night with husband, Mat Kilau.

 Dian is sleeping ."
Why the heck does the sentence ’mat kilau’d all over the enemy’ sounds better than the actual movie.
Movie title : luster mat
This malay movie on Netflix.. too poor .. low budgeted movie .. mat kilau
"mat kilau is an okay movie, I cannot stand the English accents"
"Is there another version besides Thai to Mama? I saw that Thai had it. My most favorite movie ever. The Mat Kilau is pound to lose. Laaaah, the sparkle mat hit"
"Just rewatched Mat Kilau on netflix. I love it when he started kilauing all over floor, saying ""It’s Kilau time!"".  Truly one of the movies of all time."
"How this Mat Kilau for Netflix, is the movie cool or I should keep scrolling?"
"Brother, the luster of the nation’s fighters? You know before he was with Dato Bahaman against the British near Pahang, he was in the klang war, the klang war, it was a civil war to fight for tin ore, bro learn more history instead of watching Mat Kilau movies by being fed with books"
"This movie definitely has better character building and storytelling than Mat Kilau. But action-wise, Mat Kilau wins. But then again, their movie genre are slightly different. But the main theme and message are similar."
"Mat Kilau movie is simply propaganda to bolster  sentiment

Malay fascists and Malay supremacist will never accept the flaws of this movie because then it will weaken their fascist movement

Malay. ""moderates"" will keep silent, but silence is just acceptance"
"you think defending Mat Kilau without having a vested interest in the success of the movie makes you genuine and sincere 

but honestly, it’s such a stupid movie, by Malaysian standards. To those of you who contributed to the terrrifying RM97 million box office income... wise up."
"Tried my best to be neutral, enjoy the movie and to really feel the patriotism. But the emotion is just too much. All prominent actors, overshadowing each other, Mat Kilau’s aura is not really there.."
"Is it just me, or is Mat Kilau the Movie just too overrated?"
Bruvvv!! What is this Mat Kilau movie??
omg this one kedai makan is playing mat kilau on the tv and the haters are right this movie is so goofy
"I was in the hosp when mat kilau premiered at the cinemas, and the nurses there absolutely adored that movie. say it’s very action packed, telling their colleagues to go watch and whatnot."
Mat Kilau is the best movie in humankind history. Period .
"I need to purge all the discussion surrounding Mat Kilau’s action scenes from my mind, because now I can no longer enjoy action scenes in other movies"
"Aku baru tengok Mat Kilau. Biasa-biasa je. Kalau ada scene yang best pun, masa Wahid kena tahan dengan Mat Kilau tengok Kiah kena tikam.

Movie ni boleh dibuat lebih menarik dengan dialog yang simple rasanya. Far from perfection, yet still usaha yang wajar dihargai."
Dizziness watching Mat Kilau movies. Cameraman is like illegal
"Yes agreed..
Superior movie compared to the overhyped mat kilau"
"Go back and put it on Mat Kilau’s story, watch the scale with the children. The story never ends, each of them is fighting in front of the TV . In the end, I don’t even understand what this story is about. Busy talking to people throughout the movie."
"Apasal klu comment negatif film Mat Kilau , dah consider anti melayu..but frankly,  the movie us just plain bad...all aspects"
"Bruh, I’ve seen much crude, sadistic jokes by Western satirists

Fahmi Reza’s dig on the Mat Kilau actor pales in comparison

It’s hillarious u’r tryin 2 frame a rich movie star being “bullied” by a street artist whose source of income is crowdfunding via Patreon"
"I saw Mat Kilau at the cinema because of the hype, after the movie I thought for a long time wtf did I just watch lol."
Kalau aq sorang rasa mcmtu takdela kt Twitter ni berlambak kritik bertapa teruknya movie mat kilau. Kahkah
"Because I already knew about the film Mat Kilau when it was hyped, I had high expectations. Once I look at it, errr, I don’t think it’s my taste.

It’s a bit cringe and I never liked Syamsul Yusof’s signature fight. From KL gangster again"
Mat kilau is bad movie but your thread is fake and false..
It’s not political propaganda i hate mat kilau film also because the quality as a movie i grow up watching bllywood and tllywood every friday n sunday most of the time villain is muslim we don’t condem it’s as racist it just a movie even do we know muslim in india is discriminate
Mat kilau is very bad quality movie but if you say it’s a racial movie then you have some mental problem everytime i watch bollywood and tamil movie on friday and sunday almost everytime the villain is muslim but we ok with it 4 me it just movie you trying to politize everything
"I’m sorry but Mat Kilau is one of the worst Malaysian movies I’ve ever seen. In terms of technical of course it looks great and the shots are nice but at the end of the day, if it’s bad storytelling, it’s still a bad movie idc."
"Selera org Malaysia ni pelbagai, just watched Mat Kilau at Netflix. Cerita ok, pelakon ok, overall all ok. Bg saya Mat Kilau x ada cacat n cerita to enjoy. Movie are made for everyone to enjoy. Sempat tumpah air mata waktu Rokiah kena bunuh."
Puak2 liberal Melayu fanatik  movies yg anti filem Melayu spt Mat Kilau. Ambik kau! Hadaplah filem superhero   ciptaan puak2 pro  iaitu Marvel & MarvelStudios.
"This Mat Kilau film is also lowkey gore actually. When the British soldiers were ambushed, there were also many violent scenes that were not suitable for children to watch."
"""Mat kilau is propaganda movie to villanise other races"" statement
Said by Chinese/Indian = almost 0
Said by Malays = A lot
Melayu = Buat teghuk"
Me and my gurls watched mat kilau for the first few minutes and then we changed it to something else. Not because the movie was bad..but those kids getting shot was just too much.
"Movies! Buffalo Boys, and Mat Kilau! Indonesian and Malaysian respectively"
"still amazed when I saw it for the first time on netflix. For me, the biggest reason why the movie Mat Kilau is successful is that it is a historical movie genre that is not cliche like a typical Malay movie. As a regular viewer, I enjoy it but there is a lot of room for improvement that we should accept that it exists"
"That day, people made a fuss about Mat Kilau blah blah blah blah. I think it’s like Mat Kilau, this cult movie. I just watched it on Netflix. Looks like these previews are too much. Want to accuse the preview/review of bribery, there is no proof. Suspicion of those who can."
"thoughts on mat kilau

1. it has everything that i absolutely hate in a syamsul yusof movie (TERRIBLE sound mixing, migraine inducing shaky camera, annoying timing for slow motions and zoom ins) there r some neat shots tho
2. fight choreography were cool
3. betoooo...."
"my point is: just bcs it’s a historical movie about our local hero, does not mean it is a good one. there’s still ruang for improvement though. i hope the next movie about our hero will be much better than mat kilau"
i didnt have any expectations for abang long fadil 3 so it was an average movie for me but the cinematography and camera work for the actions are better than some (mat kilau)
"But there is a basis, somebody with a big idea, find funds and make a movie that can beat Mat Kilau’s sales. That’s right, I don’t really want to support the Mat Kilau movie, but if there is a better idea, use a better technique or technology, and beat the success of the Mat Kilau movie."
"All the noise about Mat Kilau, sis, I want to share it. Just watch it once, it’s ok if you want to repeat it. This movie reminds me of special moves + hypocrisy hmm eeeii I’m not good at reviewing this movie"
Movie Mat Kilau tak salah. I even enjoyed watching it
"I don’t understand why some Malays unable to understand Mat Kilau movie deeply. Some of them believed we should againts opposition nowadays but infact we should unite againts the Malay government that we have now

Ini adalah penerangan yang jelas dan tepat sampai lubang usus"
Mat Kilau on Netflix seems like a different experience compared to watching in theatre. Watching it in theatre the speaker so loud and loud and loud but in netflix feels like a normal sound movie
"I’m Malay. Malay movies I watch. Even drama. Malay songs I heard. A lot of bass. I celebrate Raya because I am Muslim, not because I follow the Malay tradition (Ramadan ofkos is why I fast; it is obligatory for me).

But this Mat Kilau movie is not possible. Cam haghammmm hampeh."
"But the script, plot, the cinematography, the camera work etc. Its just not that good as how ppl make it sounds like. Cause honestly, this aint the first malaysian movie with such historical theme but im pretty sure i can name few old movie that is way better than mat kilau."
i told you mat kilau movie is not that great
This Mat Kilau film is really infallible. What is the best way to do it? Complain
"Originally, many people were triggered when people criticized the movie Mat Kilau"
"That’s what for me, making a Mat Kilau film is really out in terms of making a lot of angles out, but what is he trying to convey to the audience until there aren’t many Malaysian directors who want to make this historical movie and also raise the Malay spirit of young people instead of the West?"
"That’s syamsul yusof, why did he get the script, the movie became a commercial success because of the legendary name, if it wasn’t for Mat Kilau, it would have been lost"
"One of the strong parts from the movie Mat Kilau is the story that he never gets bored. Even there are a lot of significant dialog and technical problems, but it’s a good start to produce a local historical movie that doesn’t get boring even if other historical movies are technically good. That’s why there are two types of opinions"
"Duh, the one who just saw Mat Kilau is so tired to complain. Look at it. Just enjoy the movie. Even the name is ’inspired’ by historical stories. It’s just a story. It’s crazy"
"Mat kilau doesn’t meet my expectations, I was looking forward for a movie with a classic style of language like in puteri gunung ledang, but he has dialogue like the times of today, I don’t know what’s so hype, for me it’s normal, I like merong mahawangsa n puteri g.ledang"
"Baru tengok Mat Kilau and tak boleh brain how few bangsa melayu failed to acknowledge the history.

Forget your cinematography it is still watchable and educational. Without the movie i doubt they would read on Mat Kilau."
I can watch Mat Kilau. I can stand stupid movie from David Teo. I’m a movie lover.
"Abistu has already reviewed the movie that he gave is a bad movie. The film is Mat Kilau, can’t it be bad?"
"why is it that when Mat Kilau came out, there were not many people condemning the movie, what’s the point of the camera, once you enter netflix, there are many crazy bad reviews"
"pandai betul komen pasal mat kilau, even though its not a good enough explain the history, you should respect their effort for making that movie."
"Yes, aku enjoy tonton Mat Kilau, both di pawagam & Netflix. 

Aku jg enjoy Mencari Rahmat, Prebet Sapu, Fly By Night & Jagat. 

Ya, aku jga peminat Aronofsky, Tarantino, Kurosawa, Lynch, & ramai lagi. Aku pencandu filem. Dan di mata aku, this movie is average. Not great, not bad."
watch a movie called MAT KILAU.
"The amount of people complaining about mat kilau makes me wonder, how many times did movie fans see it at the movie theater until it reached the biggest box office in Malaysia? How many people are stingy waiting for netflix?"
"Eee, how is tiber siott ..how did he turn to malay..when did he argue the history of malay people..he just commented about the movie instead of the Mat Kilau itself..please don’t embarrass yourself here..you really lack on reading comprehension.. mostly read okay.."
"The moral value that I can get from this Mat Kilau movie is a sentence spoken by Mat Kilau at the end of the movie. ""The important thing in the struggle is to fight for God. Not to fight solely for the sake of race and others""."
"I’ve seen Mat Kilau on nexflix. Overall it is a good movie. Even though some people say that the script is boring, if you really understand the meaning behind the script, you will understand. It’s normal that people are not the same. I don’t blame them. Everyone has their own opinion."
Like what u need to watch from cinema first to get it or whatt comeon just support it its not harmful plus u pay for neftlix u can watch a lot of movie its not like u pay only to watch mat kilau but the people that watch it from cinema they pay only for mat kilau
Okay but what type of dialogue that you guys expect for Mat Kilau huh i dont understand this folks and i saw somes that waiting for a big plot what??? Comeon its a historical movie ....if you want to watch it then watch it if ure not interested then dont
"Mat Kilau’s critics/reviews should’ve been a week tops after the movie was released, not after it was shown on Netflix."
I’m really lazy to watch the power comment about the Mat Kilau movie. I don’t even know what you expect in that story.
"Done look at Mat Kilau. Fast storyline. Malay clothes are not worn, they should be worn before they are real. the movie filter is too bright. The character & impact of Wahid (Beto)— making Mat Kilau’s story more palatable. Sess"
"Those who have watched mat kilau on Netflix, then there are those who are not satisfied, why don’t you be like that .. if you want to be satisfied, watch the movie .. that’s the right feeling, watch mat kilau .. I’ve watched it 4 times already I think I want to see it again but later first"
"Poor and stingy people just want to watch Mat Kilau on Netflix. Org has seen the film on cinema for a long time, he just wants to make noise because he’s a movie reviewer"
">People complaining about that Mat Kilau movie
Oh, now you wanna complain? The movie was out 3 months ago..where the fuck were you fucks then?"
"Aku jarang gila tengok filem melayu. I love romance movies and malay romance cringe gila biasanya. Aku tengok cerita Mat Kilau dekat wayang hari tu. Honestly, I’d watch the movie over and over again. I admit watak Kilau tak perlu serious sangat to the point he looks heartless."
Love or hate Mat Kilau thats on you. Idc about that movie. But if I decide to watch it and its shit. Imma judge yall mat kilau fan taste in movie
"Pasal mat kilau thingy tu. Why people koyak sangat?…bukan ke tu movie je? Cant we just enjoy watching something?? Aren’t movie or film is something we watch to escape reality? If u like it thn like it, if u dont thn stfu. Historical tak historical benda just a fictional…"
"It’s true what they said in the movie Mat Kilau, you can think it’s just a story to entertain but take it so seriously that you want to fight every day.."
"i dont get how mat kilau’s movie is getting a lot of shit, betul lah kata syers , melayu pecah belah"
"5 minutes early... Mat Kilau..
*sound effect Mat Kilau like you see Dragon ball.. 
*change another movie.."
How can you even think of watching the movie Mat Kilau?
"Movies to watch:
- Private Sweep
- Mat Kilau
- Ek Villain Returns
- Puteri Gunung Ledang"
Why can’t you curse Mat Kilau film? Other movies are not even curse-proof. Every movie deserves to be judged.
"I’m ok with the movie Mat Kilau, only if the opponents act like KL Gangster. Just make it normal. But because the market here likes rival stories, the heavy biography genre, how well does it sell in Malaysia."
"I want to talk about Mat Kilau. That movie is an over-budget theater performance that lacks depth and plot. 

I also want to talk about Abang Long Fadil 3. That movie was fun, silly and beautifully choreographed."
"Hahaha, it seems that after watching the movie, you didn’t read the real history of Mat Kilau. So please shut up. Because the more you sound the more you appear to be one of the people who failed the history subject first.

*I’ve seen the movie but I still don’t understand it."
Terus masing2 nk keluar terpaling berilmu  Bagi aku oke je movie mat kilau.. Takdela teruk seperti yg diperkatakan.
"brain fall? where is netflis free, as far as the Mat Kilau is concerned, it’s a grade c movie"
"Watch the movie PUTERI GUNUNG LEDANG. big gap from Mat Kilau. The type of images, the style of conversation, the way the story is told... the difference.. 2004 vs 2022, the difference between the 2004 film and 5 stars."
"Look, I’m not hoping for The Imitation Game level of history-biographical movie, but since the title itself is called Mat Kilau..we should at least get to see a character arc of Mat Kilau rather than just this righteous figure yang pandai bersilat that we’re getting."
This film is still the best from Mat Sparkle
Can you not defend the Mat Kilau movie like Maguire defended
"Dude can’t even tell how kritik works like lepastu kata kita melatah mostly orang condemn the scripts and cara record video, takde kena mengena dengan bajet. tkde siapa cakap pasal bajet. If you think Mat kilau can be better, give your suggestion to make the movie even better"
"Mat Kilau as a movie yes
But the real history of the man is not an insult
Malay Culture=/Malay History"
"Im malay. Maybe more malay than you or the rest. But I will never watch Mat Kilau because

1. Just another shitty movie.
2. Actor Adi Putra is hardcore UMNO ass licker
3. This is a propaganda film.
4. With ticket sales 100m, show how fuxxed up malay mentality."
mat kilau is the worst movie ive ever seen wtf
"man it’s dangerous to say i don’t like things anymore
not liking mat kilau the movie are prone to get attacked 
it’s a fiction, a movie and this is soc med
we get to say what we like bout the movie or not
why are we being sensitive again?"
"I’ve already talked about 6 people shooting 1, bro, even Fast and Furious can jump buildings using a car. If you want to make a movie, there’s a point. If you want to use logic, don’t look at the Mat Kilau, look at National Geographic, there’s all the logic there."
"Compared to movies in the country, there are still a lot of shortages, Merongmahawangsa, Lieutenant Adnan, Bukit Kepong, he has cinematography, dialogue and storyline that are not brilliant, but we as viewers are not bored and happy to enjoy this kind of movie."
As history movie lover I’m approved Mat Kilau . Sis so emosi
"The local movie, Mat Kilau just went from ’terbaik’ in the cinemas to ’teruk’ on Netflix.

Different category of audiences with different expectations?

Or the movie is average? Haven’t watched it yet - will wait for it on tv"
"Ok done, watch a little Mat Kilau movie near the pc monitor. During the fighting scene. Dizziness . People’s cameras don’t have a stabilizer on their phones so they shake like that ."
"Just watching mat kilau. Very cool movie, it is easy to understand and talk about. Definitely not for starbucks folks, but for teh tarik drinker this is some topic and maybe a start to you know, way to move forward. We are too comfortable to appreciate the past."
"It’s good to make a trap in the forest, suddenly the British can come out recklessly like that. I feel angry when I watch this Mat Kilau movie"
"people are rowdy not because of the Mat Kilau, but because of the quality of the movie itself."
"Mat Kilau is fucking ass. The cast, script, production, sound effects, etc. But at least our Malay friends finally have a local superhero movie for themselves.

Not surprised why they’re all excited."
"Calling Mat Kilau a propaganda movie is giving a bit too much credit. Good propaganda movies rely on less lazy writing, if nothing else.

Its makers were so lazy they had turbaned Sikh soldiers speaking in Hindi. Like, what?!

Even in fiction, this bit is just ludicrous."
"Aah bro, I pay for netflix and the fastest wifi 120 is really just for Mat Kilau. Hundreds of other movies on netflix don’t get a single cent. I don’t even use my wifi for other things.. I just go back to the cave bro, that’s the best"
"Mat Kilau the movie had the big disclaimer that it was a work of fiction at the beginning (on Netflix anyway), while the ""memorial note"" ensures the viewer is aware this is a historical figure. 

Conflating nationalism, fact, and fiction is the real movie, starring us, TBH"
"Alright, thats enough. Muting the word Mat Kilau because you fucks are annoying as fuck. Movie is shit, deal with it. Tiada ganjaran syurga bagi yang pertahankan"
"I don’t hate the Mat Kilau movie, i just think it isn’t that good"
He clearly said that the movie is fiction and inspired by Mat Kilau. What kind of history is it if from the beginning to the end you fight by talking without looking at the camera
"Seeing everyone’s Mat Kilau reviews and realizing I couldn’t make it past the first 5 minutes. 

These people who lasted the entire movie are people of great resilience and powerful capability to hate-watch something with such patience."
The award for the stupidest rant on twitter goes to rant movie mat kilau
"""The film Mat Kilau is not made in the Pahang accent, there are many disputes, but the movie Lion King, Finding Nemo is not even a language dispute."""
glitter movie mat
"It’s deaf against this Mat Kilau Mat Kilau fans. If you don’t like it, don’t bother watching it. Don’t be a demon inciting other people, don’t bother watching. Not everyone is interested in Avengers. And not everyone is interested in Mat Kilau. Do you understand? There are many other movies you can watch on netflix."
"The Netflix Mat Kilau issue is like this. Many of our people cannot allow other people to have different personal opinions. I don’t like one Msia band, I have to chop it up. I don’t like the movie Mat Kilau, it’s not patriotic."
"As for Dato Maharajalela’s movie, I hope to add more camera shake, which Mat Kilau is just a little bit"
"It’s like Netflix has a Mat Kilau story. If you don’t like it, watch another movie. Ip man to thor to."
Right.. that’s what I don’t understand anti-Mat Kilaute fans. Ready to mention other movies like It’s like anti kpop fans.
"What do you do when it feels like nothing else can be watched on Netflix?

Not Mat Kilau movie. Never."
"The script is so cringe, so funny as the talk. I patted my head the most when the part of the British colonists had a chance to lecture about the weakness of the Malays in front of the Sidak mat kilau even though they were attacked by the Sidak at the beginning."
Done look at Mat Kilau. His story is not bad. Camera shaking? That’s because the scene is suspended indeed. You will find a lot of shaking cameras in any action scene movie. Even in the Avengers there is a mat
i think mat kilau was good for a local movie idk why y’all are so pressed abt it
"There is no issue with this Mat Kilau. It’s even the name of the movie. If all of a sudden Syamsul Yusuf wants to make everyone in there write poetry, the dagger has power, Mat Kilau can fly, there is Ismail Sabri from the future to help Mat Kilau, all that is possible."
"Everyone talked about Mat Kilau, but if someone wants to make a movie, I’m still fighting to see Henry Golding as Rantap!!!"
"why don’t the people who judge the Mat Kilau movie really relax, you tell the story of a bored omputih, you don’t want to judge 14 days and 14 nights. This story has been going on for a long time, why are you up again? Is it triggered because many people support and watch?"
Mat kilau movie die-hard fans are so weird
"I just saw the Mat Kilau before I think the movie is ok. A movie about Malay history, right? History is like that, it can be changed at will. What you want to show is history."
Mat Kilau is a flop in my books. I dosed off. PAS-centric. Silat is a beautiful art  but unnecessary camera movements my eyes ached.  camera movement was the best. Weak storyline. is still the best in terms of periodic-ish local movies like this.
"I don’t like Mat Kilau’s story, pro colonialists say

If you like Mat Kilau’s story, he says that we have a bad taste in movies

Enough ?"
I will not pay monthly just to see Mat Kilau. Must want to watch other drama series/movies
Doesn’t Mat Kilaur. It still beat mat kilau in box office. Not sure why you going with % of watchers when your main claim is that no Punjabi movie beat mat kilau in box office. I gave you evidence and you did the favour to embarrass yourself. Really fail reply clown
"There’s no end to the chatter about the movie mat kakakaka, you’re just stupid"
"There is nothing free.. Even monthly is still paid.... I pay rm 55 to subscribe to netflix.. Like I pay rm 55 for every 1 movie on netflix... If I don’t see that Mat Kilau once, I pay rm 55 to see Mat Kilau.. If I see 10 times, I will pay rm 5.5.. Stupid Phm?"
"Haha, with a huge Indian population still cannot beat Mat Kilau. Nobody watches stupid movies la bodo"
"The feeling of watching Mat Kilau at the cinema is different if you compare it to Netflix. At the movie, I feel like it’s not bad. When I look back on Netflix, I feel like this movie is garbage"
"Mat kilau teruk do. Jalan cerita, fight scene, script / dialogue are too corny. 100 juta tu kena scam ke cane? It was too hard to watch after 30 mins into it. Was laughing and cringing throughout the movie. Theres are lots of great malay movies. This aint it"
There are many negative comments about the movie Mat Kilau. The difference between looking at the skin and looking at the content. Weak...
"Mat Kilau is, without a doubt, a horrible movie. Individuals who enjoy it have a low standard for quality film. That concludes the tweet."
In vain Mat Kilau fought to defend religion & homeland only for the modern generation to lower the flag at half-mast to respect the former colonialists. That’s the correct sentence. People want to chat about movies.
"Real idiot Sikhs. 30% inflation? Haha. Your grandfather from the movie Mat Kilau taught you ah pundek? Hindi movie u claim to b Punjabi, indeed Sikhs are all liars"
"Mat Kilau is 8/10 for me but I wish they couldve removed 90% of the dakwah in the movie. You can say ikhlas kerana Allah but dont say things in the line of ""destroy opressors, protect tanah melayu for Allah"" etc. 

I dont see Allah plays deus ex machina in your movie..."
"Has he been noisy for days about this Mat Kilau movie? That’s it, Malaysian people, wow."
"Even watching Netflix is paid, but in Netflix there is not only Mat Kilau, there are many other movies.. if you don’t want to watch, you can watch other movies, if it’s a legitimate movie, we only pay to watch that story.. so the tweeter said watch Netflix is free, I understand what he means"
"Why did many people hit the Mat Kilau after it was shown on netflix? Was it the greatest movie on earth? Definitely no. But I did enjoy it despite the plot that was so meh. Maybe the experience at the movie theater and TV is different, I’ll see at the movie theater but it’s in the right mood...but I’ll check later"
this mat kilau discourse is so lame like u can like a movie and still admit that it’s bad
"He sounds like you’re a Thor movie fan. I’m a fan of Mat Kilau stories. When people curse on Twitter about Thor’s story, are you angry? ""Thor is the worst movie I’ve even seen.."" like that. Like what they did to Mat Kilau. And not for a full explanation. I prefer the storyline of CGI."
Watched mat kilau for like 10 mins then tido. I was like ni movie ke ceramah agama
"I’m angry. Because I think the story of Thor Thunder & Love is not the best, I will not curse on Twitter. But, when it’s a Malay story.. it doesn’t Mat Kilau. You will judge.. it’s not fair, right? Judge is the worst movie. But don’t even explain why?"
"I think Mat Kilau will throw up watching the Mat Kilau movie.
#melayu"
"people don’t make a lot of noise about cite Mat Kilau. I’m not weird. Like seriously, is there a Malay movie that I don’t think is the best? nothing like that"
"Jenuh la kalau nak buat semua movie logik. Nama pun fiksyen. 

Dah kalau askar tu tembak mat kilau at one time, movie tu jadi 15 minit je dah habis. Tu jadi short film. 

Fighting scene over sangat? Part bunyi ye, tapi bayangkan tumbuk sepak tak bunyi apa, nampak action je"
"Many local movies are the best. But Mat Kilau is not the best. Also, created by Malay supremacists. After that, I’m smart enough to think for myself, I don’t want to be told too"
"Yang kutuk2 movie mat kilau ni memang benci habis cara tweet tu. Memang macam baru lepas tengok movie paling teruk dalam hidup bunyinya. 

Maybe tengah trending orang kutuk2, so ramai yang join the party nak dapat like retweet sekali."
"The problem is correct. If it’s a hollywood story, release the same scene as in the Mat Kilau. This tribe does not want to condemn. When it’s a Malay movie, you’re quick to tweet everything you don’t like and then you’re happy to say that Malays can’t be touched, so it’s weak because you want to insult Malays."
"ah you, if Mat Kilau dies early it won’t be a Mat Kilau movie, you’re really stupid, you want logic to follow your neck"
Fighting scenes in Mat Kilau movie was a  for me!
"Why are so many people suddenly arguing over Mat Kilau? I still think it was a fantastic movie, tak kisah la orang lain cakap apa pun. When a movie manages to make you feel strongly emotive about something, for me it is a definite success, despite its probable flaws."
Bitter betul budak twitter dgn mat kilau. Ada bkn psal movie tu tp bitter dgn kaum sendiri ahhaha. Kesian. Lahir melayu xleh tukar jd bangsa lain mat.
"why are peoples in twitter are so pressed about Mat Kilau movie? the cinematic was great, the sound and so on , wth do you guys want? borak pasal dialogue, nak kena sebaku apa? just enjoy the movie lah tak suka boleh diam. you guys tweeting shits here lagi menjatuhkan industri je"
"This Mat Kilau is great, even the storyboards are debated, people are even discussing , there are those who say STP movie is SB. Well sadly not all of Msia bro. Haha but a good director always has their own notes in the diaorg script. If it’s like Kabir, he makes a shot list ready for every scene in his script."
"Repeat after me..

""MAT KILAU IS NOT HISTORY MOVIE.
ITS A FICTION"""
"Seriously arguing about the Mat Kilau movie at TL. To be honest, I gave less than 5 stars. From start to finish, you can’t find the ’wow’ factor anywhere."
"Am I the only one who doesn’t watch this Mat Kilau? Hahahaha Alhamdulillah, you guys have watched mat kilau ready to give feedback again just like you, you have time to watch movies. My Netflix is dusty, because no one wants to look at the best movies because they don’t have time."
What a waste of your life if the movie doesn’t Mat Kilau and you want to debate. Waste time.
There are a lot of famous Twitter clans tweeting about Mat Kilau. Even the liberal Malays on Twitter are conspiring to condemn the movie now...
"Who is interested in watching Mat Kilau movie, don’t force people who are not interested to be interested. For those who are not interested in watching Mat Kilau, don’t force interested people not to be interested.

That’s just a story for me. Designed and created for film. Some like it, some don’t like it.

Naturally."
It’s crazy that Mat Kilau movies can be a debate here and there (can’t find the popcorn emoji. Corn is fine too)
"for me..best je citerr nih.. dh watched kat wayang, felt again..then twice yes I watched mat kat sparkling on netflix..for me, its ok.. where there is a perfect film. We as humans are not perfect, this is a film. Mat Saleh Pon’s historical films are boring. over ja Malaysian netizens"
"Our views will always be different. The important thing is to ""keep going"" to produce a movie that benefits the community. Good job Mat Kilau team"
"At first, I didn’t see the Mat Kilau at GSC, it’s strange why the language is not right, but when you think about the logic of the spa language, you still want to use it for movies, you want to use b.baku, it’s illegal for people to understand, right? I want to read the subs, I want to feel the scenes again.. I just got it.. Last, if you want to make a whole movie using that language, it will take time"
"Now you won’t believe how much American Political Agenda was shot in that movie but the story is pretty much shit through and through. The reason for it’s success is simple, Giant Transforming Robots Fight Each Other. Same goes with Mat Kilau,"
I wonder what people want to make a big fuss about about the film Mat Kilau tu
"Hats off to netizens who only watch Mat Kilau on Netflix and criticize the movie.

In netflix, there was a lot of trash movies before this, but I didn’t raise high reviews, even though many of them I treated like a tyke."
"(In my opinion) Mat Kilau is ok if you want to see it, but it’s not as good as it is hyped. There are still many flaws. But anyway, this movie is still successful in terms of profits"
"Pd I, not only experts are eligible to comment. Maybe yes, he is not a film maker, but he always watches other people’s movies and works to have enough benchmarks vs the hype.

Eg, I am a copywriter by profession. But as I watch manyyyyy movies, I think Mat Kilau’s presentation is still not umph, it’s too awkward."
"After this, if there’s a movie like Mat Kilau, I’ll wait for Netflix to come"
Why? Because paskal looks too personal. Mat Kilau may be too flashy and not to my preference. Air Force brings goosebumps. It looks like the struggle to escape from terrorists and the personal character element does not overshadow the patriotism element of the movie
Gosh !! Aku tak sanggup tgk mat kilau… mual terus   susukn anak sambil tgk movie mat kliau otak aku jammed
"What’s wrong with mat kilau .. haiyaaaaa .. nk movie level like hollywood to mat ? Haaa, I’m going to make a movie, will you see .. until it gets 10k collections? Erghhh .. a lot of songehh lakkk"
10 mins into Mat Kilau. Movie is shit. FTSIO
"You’re welcome to Netflix with members who don’t pay we pay for months and the info is free for you bro, Netflix buys the film Mat Kilau so its not FREE bro"
"For me, this Mat Kilau quote is not perfect, but to label this movie as bad is like disagreeing a little.. Who says it’s bad, I can say that people have very high expectations.. With a collection of up to 97 million, people remember this Mat Kilau quote very much. perfect & cohesive"
"The Mat Kilau is decent. Best action, just love the camera, God. His dialogue is not very good but still shocked to see a Malay movie like this. 3/5

After this is another hero!"
What about malay movie.. The title is MAT KILAU.
Most overrated movie. Mat Kilau. Hype mende ntah.
May those who support and criticize Mat Kilau movies continue to contribute to the development of Malaysian films and raise the spirit of patriotism of all Malaysians
Pasal Mat Kilau pun jadi isu ke? korang ni apa benda lah gaduh pasal movie. Bodoh
Mat kilau movie is Malay version of IP MAN. There I’ve said it!
"Yes, he should have asked people why he was so bitter that he even defended the film. even though he is the one who is bitter when he criticizes the long-released Mat Kilau movie"
"most malaysians rn: you hate to criticize Mat Kilau movies! 

* okay, have fun watching shit movie quality in the next 10 years. while other countries already have a ’recipe’ for certain types of movies. It’s not, it’s a history story like watching a special move on TV2"
Great actor with great skills. Just often time with bad scripts and bad directors. Like I said. Bad movies = Mat Kilau is one of them. Bad performance = None in my opinion.
"There are two groups that appear after looking at Mat Kilau.
1. Turning Art
2. Terpa Malay
Just enjoy the movie and don’t make fun of people who don’t like or like watching the movie."
Anywaysss not bad lah mat kilau and aku x faham kenapa org bgi bad reviews but yeah it’s people’s opinions and yes i do think they still have a lot of room for improvements. I’m proud that msians are now taking steps to produce this kind of movie more than the rempit one so yeahh
"We don’t condemn Mat Kilau films for nothing, but for the people in the industry to improve their products because we want to make high quality films which our neighbors Thailand and Indonesia have been doing for the past 15-20 years. Please learn, instead of sulking"
It’s a good feeling to watch a Mat Kilau movie with another netflix. That’s why a lot of people say it’s not the best when you watch this Mat Kilau film on netflix.
"Watching Mat Kilau for the first time in Netflix. Its a bad movie. Cringy. The dialog were unnatural. 1/10. Luckily watch it in netflix, so I can say the netflix version is bad. ."
"If you are looking for a decent anti-colonialist kung fu movie, ’Mat Kilau’ is pretty good. As a westerner I like the movies where the colonialists are not the USA."
Staying myself away from Mat Kilau review so i can have my own thought about the movie
I know Mat Kilau is bad and everything but I dont think that movie deserve 2/10. Its 5 or 6/10
i watched mat kilau.and lasted only 30 minutes.then i changed marathon criminal minds.and alhamdulillah i didn’t waste money buying tickets when people hyped this movie. cheated bro! cheated!
"anyway. seronok la tengok orang bergaduh pasal movie mat kilau. sebagai filem yang dah terbit, tayang. it is what it is. biarlah orang nak kritik komen apa pun. dorang yg decide nak tunjuk movie tu, so biar je lah orang nak cakap apa pun."
Bising je lebih movie mat kilau ni.. zup zap zup zap setipa tedang ngan tumbuk. Bunyi pon sama berulang ulang..  not appetising to the ears..
Mat kilau is one of it if you want a bad movie. Bad performance maybe none.
Mat kilau is a decent movie but the sound effect wow bukan main kuat lol
"The best thing is what’s bad, even if it’s bad, at least this Mat Kilau can come to teaching, then it’s easy for students to understand history instead of reading and memorizing from textbooks. Those who feel bad go make their own movies"
It’s sad to see so many people review this Mat Kilau film. No one forces you to watch Matt.
"Every line in the script is like a religious/political talk. His action scene is ok. At this stage, the Msia audience says it’s the best? A lot of people say don’t compare with Hollywood, Bollywood etc etc but shouldn’t we compare with the best so that we can improve? Mat Kilau movie"
Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa is the standard of Malay hero movies. Mat Kilau is literally a joke.
"Entahlah pada aku .

Mat Kilau tetap 9/10 .

One of the best movie yang dah cemerlang pada aku . Dengan actors & ayat yang dilontarkan semua A+ & kena dengan jiwa aku .

Orang lain nak kutuk kutuklah . Tapi Jangan sampai ""Menghina"" ."
"Damn, they are fighting about Mat Kilau again. They were fighting about the movie that was playing at the cinema."
"My mom reacted to the Mat Kilau movie: The story is okay, I enjoyed watching it. But the opponent’s part, the camera is terrible.

For me, I am like my mom. It’s fun to watch too..."
"It’s not about matt kilau criticizing xbest. zhaf...want to criticize the movie please, don’t insult people’s taste"
"this mat kilau argument, the movie was good if u compared it to any other Malaysian movies but nothing rly that astounding or extra-ordinary abt that movie. it was cringe thru n thru."
"Whatever it is, Mat Kilau is the most commercially successful film in Malaysia to date. Syamsul Yusof played to his strength (he knows he can’t to art berat movie) and really know his market"
I want to curse the movie Mat Kilau. Don’t curse Beto Kusyairy. I fight all the way
I don’t want to defend and condemn more fictional movies whose characters are just coincidences with history. Fictional. Rekaan. We should not even care if Mat Kilau is wearing a superman shirt riding a dinosaur against the British while singing Wings.
Why are people bashing this Mat Kilaute film? Are your expectations high to the seventh heaven? The gist is not much but it’s such a good movie to watch.
"The one that turns me off is this Mat Kilau, I see a lot of chatter but there is no content, I just want to check. That seems to be the lesson you got from that movie gonna mute this, have fun swearing in my mention"
It’s also funny the fanatics who can’t see people commenting on the Mat Kilau movie like this movie determines Malay sovereignty. Technical critics and pushy scripts. Each POV. Do you want a story that lifts silat and the script is okay but the budget is way lower but a good movie? My take is Grant.
I’m glad i didn’t watch Mat Kilau on the Cinema. I don’t like it. I hope future movies will improve more.
"nk tgok mat kilau kt netflix, tp baca kt twitter ramai menyesal tgok. nasib tak pegi tgok kt panggung.. baik aku tgok movie 365 days part 2."
Ok the movie mat kilau.
"okay just finished looking at the Mat Kilau. the movie was good 7/10. If I’m Syamsul Yusof’s brother, it’s best to be able to comment on where to touch up for the audience to get what they want when they watch this movie."
muted ’mat kilau’ forever because I checked tweets fighting about the movie. what’s stupid??? don’t settle settle
Wehh apa yang orang hype kan sgt mat kilau ehh i just watched it and I don’t understand what makes people hype it that much. It’s a great movie tho but gosh the acting is so
Might rewatch Mat Kilau since ramai yang bacot to see what I’ve missed during my first viewing dekat panggung. Before the rewatch I gave the movie a hensem/10 which can translate to a high 8.
"I wonder how many days people on twitter want to fight about this Mat Kilau movie? That day, when I went out on stage, there was already a row.. this continued the row. endless²"
"When i first watch the movie, i was hoping beto is Mat Kilau. Man gave a fantastic performance along side Adi Putra"
"Why is there so much hate on Mat Kilau? Chill bro, it’s not normal to see a brain shutdown movie for a moment anyway, Rokiah bro is coming!"
"Tgk Comment, it’s true that the film has a Mat Kilau finish, but the Malay people are divided. This movie is also a rowdy alliance. LOL"
"What do you expect this Malaysian film to be wow wow? People are already amazed by Mat Kilau movies because Malaysia doesn’t always have movies like that. But if you expect that there will be no error, it’s a big mistake"
"Match the emotional hang name lol. That day, Zhaf cursed the yellow girl, you said it was her right as a ticket-paying audience to comment on the movie, what’s the point of criticizing it, she insulted me even more. I’m criticizing and getting criticized by Mat Kilau fans. Hypocritical it seems"
"It’s fun to curse the movie Mat Kilau. I’m quite happy that someone is willing to make movie stories about historical figures, instead of influencers, drug addicts who speak Malay plates, rich families who want to dump them, slapstick comedy that has no direction."
the one who turned away malay butthurt crazy people comment movie mat kilau
"Sebagai pencinta filem, aku harap kerajaan tak sponsor movie sejarah and bagi exclusive contract dkt syamsul yusuf. He’s good but not good enough. Movie Mat Kilau was a disappointment. The good things about that movie are the actors, props, n choreography(excluding camera work)"
"To me the movie Mat Kilau okay-okay je. Nothing to hate on. Lines are bit cheesy tho. Colour grading was off in some shots. Cameraworks teruk tu sikit je, tak banyak pun. Tears were shed."
why org tetiba kutuk movie mat kilau ni? i watched it on cinema n i enjoyed it. it feels like it straight coming out from history textbook + the ending is “tergantung” i heard from somewhere that the actual mat kilau ran away after they won the fight? idk maybe tht was the point.
"forget about negative comments on Mat Kilau’s movie, I promise my men are all big fans of mat kilau, if you see them, you must do the mat kilau action, ready to memorize the dialogue"
"I’ve seen Mat Kilau when he praises it soar. Expectations are high. last2 .

I want to comment on the movie, the first time many comments really trigger"
"I am so  thankful for not seeing  in the theatre 

Thank you  for publishing Mat Kilau and helping me by  not wasting my money watching the movie the theatre"
Decided to give Mat Kilau a chance. Waste of 30 mins of my time that I can’t get back. Wooden acting with poor cinematography. Even the action sequence from the 80’s movies are better. Just lazy writing with poor deliverance.
"Personally, I don’t like watching movies and tv shows. Tapi aku suka sentimen cerita mat kilau yg bawa semangat jati diri org melayu dan nilai2 murni yg lain. Suka tengok banyak keluarga bahagia sama2, pakai tanjak p tengok, org muda ada semangat nak kenal sejarah, minat silat"
"So ada org record full movie mat kilau kat netflix and publicly post kat Youtube. 

Where is the morality when you are against them?"
"mat kilau’s story (not the movie) is inspirational and should’ve been done right in the movie, bcs i am not feeling the malay propaganda in this film"
"because I already know the story line & the sound at my house is not as good as in the movie. I’ll never see a movie that I didn’t understand at first, I’ll watch it again, I think it’s best because I already know the storyline & I like it because I understand it, but the Mat Kilau is upside down, people don’t like it."
"Yg baru tgk mat kilau then ckp xmau percaya review movie kt twitter lg ni mcm org paksa pula dia tgk movie tuNak tgk,tgk la.Kalau x mencapai expectation mcm yg org lain ckp,tu pendapat msg2.X pyh salahkan review org lain."
Just got back home & caught my dad watching mat kilau again for the 2nd time.. He like it.. He usually watching action western movie at Netflix only but now its malay time hehhe The movie not boring he said..complete package.. Hehhe
"I think it’s time for the movie to die, there are people who condemn this movie, but at that time they all backed up and hit you. It’s normal when you watch it back on TV, you’ll be criticized because when you first saw it, you had high expectations and excitement. when I watch it the second time, I think this movie is not the best"
"Why are the gangs of gangs who are angry about Mat Kilau being criticized?

Are you the one who benefits from this movie or do you feel that the dignity of your nation and country is being challenged?

Criticism This can be used as a step to further improve the level of our film industry. We already know it has potential"
"Cerita Mat Kilau ni boleh jd jenis filem penyiasatan. Detective movie. Cari siapa pembelot pembesar Melayu. Ending dia Mat Kilau nampak mcm korbankan diri utk kemenangan Pahang tapi scene akhir tunjuk dia tinggal dlm hutan.

Baju hitam suara garau itu ada, tinggal topeng... eh."
Butoh. Thank you 21 best coat. Mat Kilau is a Kafir Harbi movie
"Casting for omputeh roles is inexplicably bad. WTF. 

Sikh soldiers are portrayed as one-dimensional sadists. 

Mat Kilau is political propaganda wrapped in a morality play — given the movie’s cultural impact, a longer essay on this might be warranted."
"Hahaha every month he subscribes not just to watch one story, not Mat Kilau but the movie on Netflix. I don’t even have netflix free. But when you think about it, people want to wait for Netflix because they want to chill and save money, right?"
"In vain, Mat Kilau fought to defend his religion and homeland, only for the modern generation to get rowdy about movies."
"Every commenter is really persistent and makes a long thread about this Mat Kilau 

It’s just a movie.
In the movie, even cows fly to death.
Are you really confused?

Chill it out"
Knp triggered bila org komen x suka filem Mat Kilau? Kalau melayu mmg kena wajib suka ke filem tu? Chill la. Movie je pun. Org komen x best pasal filem tu je.
"whatever twitter ppl said, i still like mat kilau cuz im pretty simple. if i enjoyed the movie then i like it lol"
"Baca komen2 kat satu channel yang upload full movie Mat Kilau tu (skrg tiba2 private) mmg sakit hati. Siap doa murah rezeki, pergh jahanam perangai."
"For me, as long as I wear the tangak & like the Mat Kilau film, it’s not enough to emphasize the Malaysianness. If you really want to be Malay totok, you have to learn all kinds of Malay dialects. It’s a lively chat like a Malay, but I don’t understand all the Malay dialects that exist, ready to curse between countries"
"it’s called ""mat kilau kebangkitan pahlawan"" but i dont see mat kilau BANGKIT, dari awal dia dah memang pro.

i also believe the only reason malays were so quick to love it was because of how narrow our range of malay movies/dramas are. kudos to studio kembara for this tho!"
"Dah tengok Mat kilau dekat Netflix. Macam manalah mereka dapat kutipan beratus-ratus berjuta ringgit sedangkan kualiti cerita sinetron lagi bagus daripada movie ni.

Oh ya lupa, yang tengok semua palawan bertanjak Ketuanan Nazi melayu. Hidup Bani melayu."
"It’s a lot of fun watching this Mat Kilau movie. People’s interests are different, right? i give 8.5/10 ️"
Watched Mat Kilau on Netflix. For me the main weakness of the movie is that it did not do a good job in telling the history of Mat Kilau. It feels like a generic silat movie set during the British occupation. Who is Mat Kilau? How did he become a Pahlawan?
Too much cinematography and character development critics for Mat Kilau movie. But for me just enjoy the movie lah. Chill je guys
"Have your own opinion.. about this Mat Kilau.. at least there is a feeling of anger towards the colonialists.. that is good enough.. sometimes these tribes are one thing more than foreign movies.. littered with stories about movies.. for me, Malaysians rarely do factual story.. want to tell you to read history, study. far away.. read novels thoroughly"
"Malaysian animated movies like upin ipin, boboiboy & agent ali far better then mat kilau even though the target audience is boys."
"Watched it with an open mind, but Mat Kilau…….what a terrible movie"
"Why do many people say Mat Kilau’s story is bad/give a bad rating? That’s before, why can the movie explode?"
"Well for me.. from the point of view of the movement of the camera in Mat Kilau, it is less like a Hollywood action movie... but I appreciate the script in that movie more.. how are the Malay traits that cause the invasion of colonists, consumed by incitement and colonial influence.. ..."
"2 kali menangis sepanjang tengok Movie Mat Kilau. Fuh, terbaik!"
"Don’t compare it with anything. The film itself is cringe, there’s more action but it’s jarring here and there, the sound doesn’t match the action shown. If Mat Kilau is good for you, I guess that’s your standard of ’a good movie’ then"
Fate is not a die-hard movie watcher. I want to see an Elvis movie and I haven’t decided to settle for weeks. not to mention Mat Kilau.
gonna block everyone who complain about mat kilau i know movies are open for criticism but idc yall are just miserable people who’s chronically online
"It’s a pity to curse the movie Mat Kilau, but when I first went to the cinema, I didn’t even see the noob review, then I saw it on Netflix haha"
"Mat Kilau 10/10

Nice movie."
I’ve seen Mat Kilau on netflix already. Syamsul Yusuf’s typical action movie. I’m so bored that I don’t feel like commenting. 2/10.
"I see the best. Your mind is narrow to make a comparison with Hollywood, it’s really different, people with a budget of ten million. Mat kilau is a movie about history, where can you turn it away like an action or sci-fi movie, what do you expect ."
Do you want to have a fight with the Mat Kilau movie article? Waste time
"Are you talking about Mat Kilau again? That brother has collected millions of other people to his heart’s content, he doesn’t need to insult us who watch it.. I like watching that movie because he talks about former fighters and Islam.. this movie is not the way that brother preaches & that’s why some people don’t like it, right?"
"Also, the one who made Cite Mat Kilau is Syamsul Yusof, one of the best movie authors in Malaysia. If the movie he made is a lot of complaints, let alone another author who produced the story.
Anyway, it’s ok, at least there is a story that shows the history of Malaysia"
"Well said mate! I’m not a fan of history, but because the movie Mat Kilau has an exhaustive chapter on the history of Mat Kilau, I’m looking for reading sources. He has that effect, I can feel it baby. That’s for me, to get distracted by other movies."
"Mat Kilau eh? hahahhaha, here it is... it’s just a movie. that’s right bro. It’s like turning everything away. just let him or her be. just scroll."
"Sept 18, 2022 - I haven’t seen Mat Kilau yet, no movies & no Netflix.

Anyone who has seen it, understands that it is a movie, not the History Channel. So there’s a little adjustment, so chill.. just enjoy the entertainment"
"I think the full movie is on YouTube, right?"
I hope you can see what it’s like behind the scene battle movie 1917. Then just see how Syamsul Yusof made the Mat Kilau scene.

"A lot of movies are propaganda but a bad movie is just bad.

Also, Chaplin thrives in silent comedy so when this scene comes, altho quite obvious a propaganda, it intrigues the audience to listen.

Mat Kilau on the contrary..."
"Psl, if I watch the movie, it will go down my throat.. Dok hirau review Everyone.. just like I like eternally, there are people who don’t like it. I don’t like Mat Kilau, there are people who like it.. Lol"
"Haven’t watched Mat Kilau. Had a chance to see the Air Force.
It’s not the kind of diligent to watch movies actually, but people invite us onz. I usually had time to sleep in that 

But watching AirForce that day, I didn’t even feel sleepy. good luck"
"Its an adaptation based on what actually happened, of course some modifications were made.

The two scenes practically made the whole movie bro. Mat kilau is a real figure and how he was depicted fit his description in history, whether you like it or not."
"So I watched Mat Kilau today with my dad and the scene where the wife died made me cry and my uncle asked me ""Uy ngano ni hilak ka?"" (Why are you crying?) and I pretended that I was reading a sad webtoon manwha but anyways, it’s a great movie and I’d rate it an 8/10"
"I don’t watch it since I don’t like the movie. but if you want to see action packed, then its a good movie. I don’t want to roar at Mat Kilau fans if I don’t like it. if you want to Mat Kilau, no problem"
someone shared mat kilau movie in my telegram.. should i watch it or not?
"It’s as if he opened a Mat Kilau film just to contrast with the one he saw on the stage before, he just wanted to say that the Mat Kilau story is bad, low iq, shaky camera, only for Malays, just 10 minutes.."
Ingat kita dah moved on from Mat kilau when the movie release dekat cinema. Now we all back to square one ?
"The only bad thing in this movie is that, they didn’t make it clear enough what race and what religion Mat Kilau is."
"Louder sis.. I’m tired. When do you want to finish this Mat Kilau topic?? If it’s just a review and opinion, just do it.. No need to criticize other people’s taste.. Support local movies but criticize with prudence.."
"That day someone asked for an opinion on which Mat Kilau with Air Force is the best. I said it, air force..

He should have started a long description that is Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau, it’s the best blah blah blah

Duhh I just like watching movies.. I rarely want to judge from the cinematography, bgm, what kind of camera is it all"
"It’s not like that. Don’t judge people like that. For me, I feel crazy and strange when I read the replies in this thread that are all about Mat Kilau."
"A lot of people comment on the movie mat kilau and your expectations are very high. The movie is normal but for me, I want to compare it to other Malay movies, I think it’s okay"
"Even though I’m a fan of Marvel movies and don’t have much interest in Malay movies, the Mat Kilau is better than Thor’s stupid joke. More excited"
"Mat Kilau adalah FIRST PROJECT dari keseluruhan planned franchise dan kejayaan dia di box office tu adalah unexpected. The movie wasn’t supposed to be as great as you expected, MK is just an introduction and also boleh kira sebagai ""test market""."

Fans mat kilau cakap yang kutuk mat kilau now are Bangsa Netflix lmaooo luv how seriously they take their fandomship. Also i watched it in the cinema and back then already found it bad. Luv how if u kutuk the movie nanti kena swarm kat FB being called an ungrateful malay.
you compare mat kilau with 2013 movie?
"Aoi... 2-3 months ago you guys were making noise about Mat Kilau movies... then you are making noise again... the noise is not the ones you see at the cinema (which helped local cinemas/gov tax, but at Netflix (profit to overseas). People who Just watch it at the movie. Stupid."
"no body love british or hating mat kilau himself, we know ckp psl quality movie n tk fhm why ppl bashing like become apostates if ckp this movie is normal, over betul dh become level if rajnikanth’s character dies on stage kna burn"
"For those of you who are arguing about the Mat Kilau that got hundreds of millions, right? I want to know the amount of the lawsuit he got for the box office movie Gadis Jolobu"
Why people so pressed pasal mat kilau? It is not the greatest movie on earth but i do enjoy it.
"There are also a few of our society who are stupid.

Comparing Mat Kilau movies with commercials about community consensus."
"why is there a season 2?? why are there still so many people coming back after this movie? hasn’t it been released for a long time? no, genuinely asking"
"People hype about Mat Kilau because we are thirsty for the historical film genre

But if people don’t like the movie, it doesn’t make them anti-Malay or whatever. The movie itself sucks. It can’t be helped

No Mat Kilaur what we argue, Syamsul Yusof is still rich and we still complain about why tomorrow is Monday"
"Btw, right, you don’t like the action scene in Mat Kilau because it’s noisy and over like a Tamil movie? I’m your fav father.

"Malay movie reviewers in 2023 be like:

""For me, Mat Kilau is not the best, the dialogue feels unnatural and there are a lot of really shaky camera scenes. So my rating is 5.5/10."""
"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix, best, there is a standard. But it’s not as good as Zhaf’s review. He hyped the movie too much. Even though it’s only 3/5."
"A lot of people downgrade Mat Kilau movies after they come out on Netflix. If you want to see, just look at that humiliating noise"
"I just want to appreciate Mat Kilau just as it is.

A movie with great fighting scenes. The effort seems to involve importing foreign actors.

The historical part doesn’t even bother to comment. As compem cincai. Mmg script writer looks like he doesn’t want to show pon 

I admit a lot of speech."
"One of the factors behind the success of Mat Kilau was that Lightyears was not aired, nor was Thor. There is no other movie competition for moviegoers."
Are Mat Kilau the movie and Lawrence of Arabia of the same genre?
"Kannnnn, I don’t know, lately a lot of people are criticizing that Mat Kilau movie, but when it’s in the middle of the show, it’s beautiful and you don’t have to criticize it"
"Maybe for bro, this movie is a popcorn movie. But maybe there are a few take it as knowledge. Because there are those who are starting to discover the original story of the PSL hero Mat Sparkle and other heroes. Ok what.. ""I mean a handful of you know. Not all of them"""
"I don’t know why you want to defend the Mat Kilau movie so much, the quality is not equal, the standard of SY has that movie, he is good at trying new things & has a strong influence in commercial

but the movie doesn’t even describe the real atmosphere of Mat Kilau"
"Yes correct. But please make the story of the prophet and make it a historical fiction movie. That’s what I don’t agree with. Ni Kisah mat kilau Beb: Even though it’s big, it’s not the same. But there is also input, right: psl silat psl religion psl war with colonialists. So we take it as good input."
can mat kilau do better? yes. But was the movie good? absolutely
"It’s true that Pramlee also makes period films using the standard language of his time, but the presentation of his time is better. but I swear I love this project I got close to syamsul yusuf, for me he is good at popcorn movies and matt kilau shouldn’t be popcorn movies :("

And I am not cool... Eye candy from the style frame but not in actual footage and it the movie are forcing too much.

To be honest, most of movies by Samsul have a cringy script. I felt funny rather than angry."
"Is it really bad to watch the movie Mat Kilau? I didn’t see it tonight. Because yesterday when asked by a member he said ""I don’t know""."
"yeah its in bad taste to say about audience’s IQ. we critique mainly storytelling like low IQ meaning no complexity in character arcs, so you can shut down your brain and enjoy. Mat Kilauelleh call popcorn movie. but it’s a shame that the legend is how Mat Kilaus are made like that"
"Sis, because here, if we talk about other barbie movies, my personality is a little bubbly. so bear w me eh it’s just a character bro, it must be worse than the British character in Mat Kilau"
"For me, right, before you want to see the history of the movie, you have to look at his character. Mat kilau is a warrior + scholar, it must be his context about Islam and the struggle. Talking about Islam is a bit cliche"
A lot of people turned to foreigner after the release of the movie Mat Kilau on Netflix
"I don’t know.. I don’t even get money after fighting so hard.

Just enjoy the movie."
"This Mat Kilau is for those who are interested in 100% action movies, they will really like crazy pigs 

You really have to force your eyes and ears to watch this movie until it ends at the movie theater Ringing in the ears"
Can you imagine that the sacrifice that they do. At the end of the movie you can see most of villagers come to help Mat Kilau. It does really happen weh. Perang gerila as it was called. Please don’t mock it if you never appreciate the history. I feel sad ;(
"According to the movie Mat Kilau, you are the one who wants to fight, curse 7 generations.
It’s a movie.
No one is forcing you to watch, this is not Japanese Kempitei forcing you to watch Nihon propaganda.
The Producers are laughing their way to the bank, the more rowdy the more people watch the movie!"
"When I’m a little older, I’m not interested in watching Mat Kilau on Netflix or the cinema.

I am not sure to what extent the historical facts in this story are correct.

How time has changed. I used to love this kind of movie."
"I don’t know, even for me the Mat Kilau is normal, but I give more credit after watching Zhaf’s talk with Syamsul Yusof.

When I saw syamsul explain, I understood that the movie should be able to go further, but there were many factors that prevented it, but syamsul still did his best.

That’s where you have to salute"
"I’ve seen the Mat Kilau. Not the best. Air firce is not the best. Fortunately, I want to look at sukhoi so it’s a little better. These 2 movies are overrated"
Yea. So aku anggap pendapat yg tgk kat Netflix  yg Mat Kilau x best ni tak ni salah. Vibes tgk kat panggung & screen tv/hp mmg lain. Aku try tgk KKN di Desa Penari pun aku terlelap. Pasahal umum tahu kat Netflix  full movie. Tak mcm kat pawagam byk scene kene cut. Hahaha.
"Why is it that when it comes out on netflix, it turns me away from this movie review"
i actually don’t care mat kilau ni bagus ke tak  all i care is Malaysia is finally making a movie about historical figures  fuck off with the choreography or cinematography bullshits
"What I can say is orang yang tengok Mat Kilau dekat Netflix ni tiba tiba movie kritik terhebat. Comparing with best Hollywood movies.

First, compare it with local films. It’s a huge step up from filem rempit & gangster."
"Entahlah, I do enjoy Mat Kilau on Netflix, expect a movie from SY, dah agak style dia mcm mana, my parents enjoy, I’m enjoy, the fighting so nice, the cine not bad actually, actors n acting superb"
"I didn’t see the Mat Kilau..I’m confused because I didn’t see the movie, did I see the prime minister’s cup speech competition"
But we se still far away better than your silly movie  like mat kilau
Mat Kilau is an action comic book superhero movie. It’s missing a gorunded character who subtlety breaks the 4th wall & it’d be perfect. Was laughing 70% of the movie.
"I’ve seen Mat Kilau glitter in the cinema and on netflix

In cinemas 3.5/5
On netflix 4/5

This movie makes martial arts look so cool"
"Good comment.

Syamsul has to read the negative comments that build up his movie for his own good.

Mat Kilau’s success now is due to other factors.

The quality of this kind of film does not guarantee the success of his films in the future. He has to improve."
"Sm ppl on TW judge Mat Kilau but for me it such a good movie.Simple but enough with meaning and easy for young gene to understand.Yes maybe the CGI also script and action scene too cringe but come on how can u expect it is same level with hollywood movie , its just from local !"
Mat kilau 100 juta? Idk why collection that much tapi actually the movie is not that good. Im glad I don’t waste my money
Why do people write Japanese movie Mat Kilau. Malaysians did it
"For the 2nd time I saw my children.. even my mother went up to give a lecture.. anything that makes you remember God is not Roblox.. that’s why Mat Kilau is the best movie for me who is trying to understand my race, religion and country."
"Mat Kilau 7/10, Abang long fadil 6/10. My opinion, why brother long fadil is 6/10 because it’s cliche. I don’t know how people can rate 9/10. The movie cycle is just the same as the Mat Saleh movie and some parts are not really alive"
"It may not be suitable for some people’s expectations, we watch the movie for various purposes. The first time we saw Mat Kilau, the national hero, while watching the touching story of how our ancestors were killed at will. The 2nd time brought the children to get to know Mat Kilau."
"I think the biggest turn off for movie mat kilau tu is how inconsistent and different cara percakapan everyone. Sekejap cakap melayu baku, sekejap a bit modern. Otak aku tak dapat nak enjoy the traditional vibe (??) theyre trying to portray"
"my review on mat kilau movie:

can work harder on character development, background sound placement, camerawork, script. feel like everything is rushed nak mampus."
"As someone who watched Mat Kilau in cinemas TWICE!!! the dialogue and script mmg cringe butttttttt the language and lenggok bahasa melayu that were used is nicely done actually. It’s a movie and it’s only based on the true story, why bother?"
"Its true, memang mat kilau is way behind compared to braveheart ke or any other historical western movie.

But its a step forward from our past. From rempit movies to hantu kak limah etc, now we are making much better quality movies that portray our local figures as heroes."
What is the solution for the next movie from Mat Kilau’s criticism
Abu said the Mat Kilau of a scifi movie
"I think they know Mat Kilau kilau because it’s the movie who can remember the other name. and some of them who people consider Malay warriors are actually ’landlords’ to collect taxes. so when the British came to take over tax Mat Kilaurs, people started struggling. even though 2 times 5"
"Unpopular opinion. Mat Kilau is a propaganda movie for UMNO, PAS and other political groups that based on Malay centric Malaysia."
Have to say mat kilau is one heck of a movie
"hopefully there’d be more proper adaptations of our local heroes, but maybe the next ones bagi kat other filmmakers to give them justice.

sad really, cuz i really love the story of mat kilau as a kid. but then to see him being used as a propa movie this way kinda breaks my heart"
bcs i feel like the patriotism in me is woken up by watching mat kilau bcs its been years since the last time i watched movies like that ??
"definitely not the worst we’ve seen in terms of filmmaking, but the message of the movie itself is the main problematic thing that which some of us been criticizing against.

we for sure wouldn’t want to see more of the agenda-pushing ideas of SY’s mat kilau to be prevalent here"
"Mat Kilau cinematography is on a level where it is accepted and I will attack any other movies that left the movie ’flat’ because they are lazy. In their case, the black levels were correct."
"okay but why’s everyone saying watching mat kilau on netflix is... yk

for me it was the best experience lah. well maybe sebab aku jarang tengok movie. but overall i’m okay with it

pendapat orang lain"" kan ? camera gegar"" tu biasa lah, melayu movie kot"
I’ve watched it for free on Netflix and then it’s noisy. I’m thankful that the director is right that this movie is playing on Netflix. Do you know how big the budget is for this movie? Almost the same Hollywood level. Many are willing to fight for a seat for the Mat Kilau movie.
One more thing about movie Mat kilau ni is their script ! The script could have sounded more classic. Ni tak. Macam member cakap dengan member duduk zaman millennial.
"Movie Mat Kilau, if you have vertigo, don’t watch it. Keluaq wayang confirmed that the world is upside down. I can even watch his part of the fight scene"
All those who cursed Mat Kilau movie are those who just watched it on Netflix.. not those who watched it at the cinema.. Why eh?? Can anyone give a reasonable explanation?
"I now conclude that some malaysians dont know how to mendalami sejarah and literally make fun of everything,what’s so funny about Mat Kilau ? It’s a good historical movie with tons of heartfelt moments and scenes."
"If you cringe, don’t worry. Alas. I can’t see netflix JEEEE. If it doesn’t come out on netflix, I don’t know about this Mat Kilau movie. WEAK. If you criticize, let it be in the circle of people, bro."
I will try giving chance to Mat Kilau movie. esok la try tengok.
"Movies are a form of art. And art, as we know, is subjective. So he doesn’t really want to dictate what’s best or what’s not best for other people to the point of being determined. My opinion on Mat Kilau is one thing, his camera work makes me dizzy"
"Had to say this since a lot of talking abt mat kilau, i get yall points by saying that movie need byk improvement, but to say org2 yg tgk tu iq rendah or saying ""patutla bodoh sokong umno"" are even more stupid connotation. Ckp org lain bodoh doesnt make u look brilliant either"
"Thank god i’m not alone, i thought i was the only one who thought Mat Kilau was cringe ah. Actors was great, i just felt the movie was over romanticized with the dialogues."
mat kilau was good bru i don’t really watch malay fighting movies and even malay movies in general and mat kilau was wow
"People might expect a director to release a small movie from that era, but if you make a movie like that, you’ll get bored of that era and it doesn’t suit the taste of today’s kids. What’s wrong with the director making a movie based on what Gen Z wants to see? hmm poor malay custom."
"I don’t want to review the Mat Kilau movie too much, it’s enough just to give /5"
"Mat Kilau is 5 stars in terms of marketing, that’s why it costs 100 million.

I like Beto’s acting in this movie. His eyes are expensive."
why are so many people criticizing matt kilau for me the movie is ok & what lesson is there?
"For me it’s the best crazy movie air force, I feel like your quote should be comparable to Mat Kilau you know, because it’s crazy"
"Done tengok mat kilau  

1- honestly, personally i would rate 5/10 for this movie. Kinda overrated tapi overall okay je.

2- idk but this is just from my opinion as viewer je tau. I know i takde ilmu dlm filem tapi i have to agree bila org cakap camera time action tu gegar sgt-"
"Okay la since Mat Kilau movie is suddenly viral now, nak review lah sikittt about the movie. I give it 6/10. First of all, I like how the movie is about the historical of Malaya fighting British colonies. The point is there. But ofc la, there is a lot of the meh side of the movie"
Why do the people who comment on the Mat Kilau movie say that they watched the movie for free like that? Netflix has to pay subs. Do you see netflix shopee?
"I think the Luster Mat is many times better than Thor 4

I don’t think it’s the same as you think

You guys are born and keep watching action films"
"Mat Kilau Race Supramacy Movie!
Mat Racist!"
"Tbh, mat kilau was an ok movie. Quite decent but not that impressive. Afterall, we bought the ticket to support local film although I fell asleep at the last 30min of the movie."
"Mat Kilau is one of the interesting historical movies. Although the story line has been developed differently from the original story, from a little while ago, we have known one of the Malay fighters who have been forgotten for a long time."
"I don’t understand why it’s so noisy, this Mat Kilau is over rated. I’m ok with that quote. That’s the level of Malay movies. It’s ok because I don’t see it in a typical movie. Or a funny ghost movie that is obviously stupid.

I want to expect like the Korean cite Mat Kilau that is lambert again."
"You all complaining about the movie Mat Kilau are bored because they keep giving ""speech"" etc, if your race and religion are in danger you won’t want to chat over coffee, what are you guys talking about just take what people say as a reminder and notice"
"I’m not good at reviewing movies in the same way that I’m not very good at reviewing food. If I say it’s not the best and it’s not good, it’s a bad category. Today, many people have a Mat Kilau, Mat Kilau look. I’m ready to watch the movie twice hahaha. And still don’t know how to rate."
I literally cried so hard watching mat kilau dekat wayang and yall wanna say that movie is bad bad? Maybe yg tunjuk dekat cinema tak sama dekat netflix kot sebab wtf icb yall
"I started reading about the history of the Titanic because I just watched the movie Titanic.

It’s the same after people look at Mat Kilau. At that time, many people were interested in looking back at people to do research on Mat Kilau & read its history."
"My favourite moment was when Mat Kilau said ""It’s Kilau Time"" and kilaued/defeated the British soldiers. Definitely one of the movies of all time."
You enjoyed the movie ok. You’re not enjoying it then ok too. To each their own. Terrrpaling la pulak dia penat baca tl belum habis lagi pasal mat kilau.
"My 8-year-old stepdaughter has an interest in Mat Kilau. He was really excited when he saw the movie Mat Kilau that day. Until now, he is still crazy about Mat Kilau. From Mat Kilau’s story, he found many other histories. I’m tired of answering."
"It’s crazy how lively this RRR movie is hahaha
For 3 hours, it doesn’t fade like a Mat Kilau"
The anti-Malay thing is endless and turns to Mat kilau’s movie review. It’s okay to be stupid.
"It’s like I’m in a scene like that Hindustan movie, that is in one of these scenes where Matt puts a dagger on the neck of Captain Syers.. whispers his name and then his music score comes out."
"A simple review about Mat Kilau film:
I just watched LPs on Netflix last night, for the first time, it’s standard local films, with the action sequence style, the most important thing is slow motion, there must be slow motion, & I noticed one scene, it looks more or less like a Hindustani film scene."
"I just watched Mat Kilau yesterday. I’ve been watching people update their ratings, hmmm, personally, there are a lot of shortcomings in this movie, but the story is great for the dialogue and acting part..."
"I watched mat kilau when it first came out with my sister. Legit could not take the movie seriously because I look at adi putra, all I see is Jai from KL gangster. I can’t hold in the laughter every time my mind makes the comparison."
Many of them biiter with movie mat glitter rilek dah laa
"That’s right, then it can be pointed out that corruption doesn’t follow the fight of mat kilau, that’s why all things want to be polytaic

People just serve the movie not to treat the polytaic trash story, want to polytaik wait for the pru la, mess to maki film mat glitter just want to maki politaik party about"
"The thing is, if it had been a GOOD movie based on Malay historical figures, it would have appealed to non-Malays as well. As if we all didn’t learn about Mat Kilau in school?

But it was deliberately made in such a way as to alienate non-Malays."
"Just wondering, will Mat Kilau, the movie, be able to influence the masses in the upcoming GE 15? Is it significant enough to create sentiments among the voters?"
Condemn mat glitter like he’s a movie director
"Yang ulas (setelah menonton di Netflix) seolah olah pergi menonton Mat Kilau di panggung wayang ni ialah penonton yg low IQ.. Terpaling melayu.. Lah pasal movie pun sanggup menghina org lain.. 
Filem ni mmg byk yg berlobang tp santai lah."
"Haritu went to see Mat Kilau at the movie. So yesterday i sent him photo of Adam watching the movie. He replied, oh i know this movie. It’s Mat sumting right? I’m tired of being friends with this mat salleh. He didn’t register to vote after this I went vietnam thrash him!"
I don’t know if I’m not interested in history or that Mat Kilau’s movie is bored
"i have seen a lot of negative comments towrds mat kilau and honestly everyone can have their own opinion right? so imo, there’s no harm in liking that movie eventho its fictional but we all know the fact that Mat Kilau is a real person."
People who like low-budget movies would probably like Mat Kilau and believe it’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened since their standards are so low. Mat Kilau is simply a film that caters to this audience.
"Mat gleam’s not really good 

The best Malaysian historical movie is actually Merong Mahawangsa"
"Few days ni banyak orang kurang berminat dengan Mat kilau tayang di netflix & comment about the movie.

kenapa ek ?"
Very lacking in history in this Mat Kilau. So don’t expect more. There’s a lot of facts that don’t go wrong with that movie. To do a time when boredom can be
"People complain stories Mat Kilau camera shaking is suitable for malay, lah..... i mean u guys right. But the story aduhhh this is my second movie where I stood maki in front of the TV after Bukit Kepung."
He’s the guy playing ’Mat Kilau’ in the movie.
"1. Script cringe 
2. Mini reunion Gerak Khas
3. Naively narrated 
4. Though the name of the movie is Mat Kilau, from the movie alone, how much did we get to know Mat Kilau? Imo, Beto*s character was more dominant 
5. Sound effect fighting scene melampau, kalah citer Rajinikanth"
"citer mat glitter....

Great actors he 

I know who’s playing but when it’s not this movie, from the start hah~ the lineup he’s pergh"
Hahah abah says mat glitter is inspired by the movie wong feihung reason sound effect mcm Chinese martial art movie
Movie mat kilau not best save money I don’t see in the movie with the scene action swaying camera man shooting that squeamish also to
"Not going to even bother watching Mat Kilau. The decline of the Malaysian movie industry is as clear as day.

We have stopped learning, stopped innovating, stopped trying. We have the best neighbors (eg.Indo,Thailand) to learn from, but no, we reward mediocrity."
The raid was an Indonesian film.. The director of Captain America admitted that his fighting scenes were inspired by The Raid. Samuel L Jackson also said The Raid ia his all time favorite movie.. Is this mat sparkle you likened to The Raid?
"Special Motion series
PASKAL 
Evo Police 
Mat Kilau

All have their own class.

Maybe we don’t know how many children their exposure to the police/soldiers/heroes came from this movie.

For me, this is more important than debating the subjective issue of cinematography."
You see jela badang the movie mat glitter doesn’t hurt your soul hahahah
Lali other people art.. Cara Ko for the opinion of Bole was received with the highest sales of Movie Mat Kilau in Malaysia to date.
"Can y’all please STFU about reviewing Mat Kilau? If you like it, great. If you don’t, it’s alright. Everyone has their own taste when watching movies or TV shows. But if y’all make shit up just to fight over a MOVIE, go fuck yourself and touch some grass outside!"
Actually i want to rate mat low luster actually because throughout the story i can evaporate. Rarely happens ye. But because of the movie tickets people are shopping so i end up rate it’s high say it’s good but it’s not the best actually.
"Tak tau kenapa tengok filem pun boleh tau IQ orang. Kalau kau rasa mat kilau tak best, cakap je lah tak best, bukan taste kau. Tapi nak judge IQ orang yg tengok based on 1 movie dia kata best sangat mengarut."
I love all these reviews about Mat Kilau on FB  that movie is just overrated
"Mat Kilau memang kureng tapi pengabdi setan ITS different bro, so sorry we have better movie industry"
"Sorry i can’t give my review for Mat Kilau yet, because the one that is on Netflix rn is just a 2-hour long epic movie trailer.. i believe the actual movie will be released soon"
"Lah mat kilau ni patutnya movie menyatukan melayu, ini makin berpecah bergaduh???????"
It’s come to many x love Mat Kilau’s movie
Mat glitter is indeed a movie for me ordinary jer. But it’s not very bad. This movie could fetch 90 million. But you don’t have to be the smartest for criticism. You recorded a selfie video of yourself pom begegar. Acah2 wants to criticize .
Finally being able to watch Mat Kilau after Netflix menyiarkannya bermula dari semalam. In my honest opinion eventhough got alot of things to improve it’s still a great movie.
Mat glitter is indeed a movie for 1 time to see not repeat many times. Tpi movie this is not so bad as a netizen censure. No need for bad comments to denounce people regardless of your tweets. You’re not the one who used the pom.
"I hope to see Mat Kilau’s character live, what his personality is. His conversational style. All I understand is the philosophy of the end. script causes movie n character Mat Kilau is not alive"
"When Mat Kilau came out near the neflix came out the most critics of the movie comment, this is not to mention Air Force has a story out neflix, ghisau most soldier comment later. Guys, to produce a movie that requires the mental and physical sacrifice of every production member."
"Why time Mat Kilau in the movie most rates 8/10 , 9/10, 100/10..

But when it’s on Netflix, people rate 2/10, -3/10??

Ready to take that one movie in three days.

It’s just a plan to see this tomorrow."
Kakakaka mende lah beria bekap movie mat glitter.
The name of the pon movie is not his diary of mat glitter and friends. Don’t show me that stupidity on social media. Shame woooo
"That neutral means, try you’re not a Malay, and you don’t know the glitter. The character development in the story is very low. The plot of the mess does exist, e.g. awang, the motive for the creation of the role of the money is unclear. Wanted to make a drama in a movie, but it didn’t make it. From start to finish,"
Ok I’m not talking about this Mat Kilau. What’s the mess that’s going to be. But for me it’s not a big impact to have a movie.
"Thatla, many unaccredited movie reviewers were born after the mat on Netflix"
"I’m going to compare it with Merong Mahawangsa because the movie is best despite years ago has a movie. Ending is satisfied, not messy. It’s not even a conclusion. It looks very, like you’re OBLIGED to do a movie under 2 hours"
Whats the fuss about the Mat Kilau movie btw? Everything is bad. N the lack of extras in each scene just shows that the movie is bad. Really bad.
"If I’m not mistaken, waktu Mat Kilau keluar cinema, everyone like, ’it’s good’, ’great movies’ and whatsoever. And then keluar Netflix, everyone give bad reviews? What happened?"
Mat Kilau is one of those movies that you love watching the first time and would absolutely hate watching it the second time
"Ever hit the IP man’s story? Mcm where he’s against 10 people. But what attacked him wasn’t all at once. Same story mat glitter. That’s the name of the story. To make sense, you read history. No need for a movie."
"Just after seeing the Mat Kilau. It’s like just after watching the isley Malay speech. Scene fighting brain turns, cameras moving faster than the silat. Is this the most movieous Jela taste?"
tl today all discuss the issue of movie mat glitter to
Is Mat Kilau really that bad of a movie? (Serious question)
I only watched first 5 minutes of mat kilau to already know what’s the rest of the movie gonna be like. And it’s not what i expected at all based on the sales it made when it came out.
"Nak bagi pendapat takyah nak petik Melayu, boleh jaa letak comment beradap, comment with manners, ni siap mention movie utk orang IQ rendah bagai, tengok movie Mat Kilau saja dah boleh hilang adab ka? awat hari ni semua org try hard jadi si Zhafvlog ,"
"Mf be like Mat Kilau is a 3/10 and compare it to IP Man when the Malaysian movie track record is Evolusi KL Drift, Impak Maksima and Bini-Biniku Gangster"
"What’s the case of the rampaging dock about Mat Kilau? Relax. Like this subjective. Some people like some who don’t. Tak pyhlah want to back up over sgt or kutuk beriya sgt. To me, #MatKilau can be 1 of my favorite patriotic movies besides Bukit Kepong & Lieutenant Adnan."
"None,we watch Mat Kilau and other action/horror malaysian,indonesians,philipines movies"
"A little comment is already about the movie mat glitter. There’s more like he’s terer all things, terpaling palatao"
"Sejak Mat Kilau dah masuk netflix, ramai pulak yg buat review.. mcm mne kutipan berpuluh2 juta, tp review mcm movie ni meh sgt..
Aku tunggu Air Force msuk netflix, nak baca review ade tak yg sependapat dgn aku"
I think people are expressing their disappointment on mat kilau because we rarely get a biopic movie about pahlawan negara. Last time was leftenan adnan? Decades later baru dapat mat kilau (correct me if im wrong) so they expect something wow in 2022
"Done watching the most viral and hype movie ever this year, Mat Kilau. Although it was super cringe but not bad for a Msian producer. I would rate 0/10."
It’s never over about Mat Kilau. The race is rich Mat. Aoi. treat jelah movie coat. Haha. What to do in Twitter haha
"1 month ago we have supporters who went absolute total blind die hard support on Mat Kilau as if that was the best Malaysian movie ever. 

Now we have detractors who criticize the movie frame by frame like it’s total worthless."
"Mat Kilau is a movie. But the netizens who tossed it to the point should not be criticized. Some critics like it should depict 101% history, which doesn’t make sense because movie is made to appeal to the most profitable segment."
"Uwow just realised there’s a lot of prejudices on Mat Kilau movie. 
From historical sides of the movie, I think there is not much to be learned as this is not a biography. But to say the movie is for ""Melayu yg rendah IQ"" is too much."
"Mende you this. I’m not flat-hitting all the movies. But before the movie mat glitter starts, there’s a writing out to tell me this movie is just fiction. Not round round. Some have also been changed. That’s what it’s all about. You’re the one who’s not focused, you’re going to talk to me. It’s a lot of porn."
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau. 

It’s an enjoyable movie. Despite its flaws, weakness and over use of fast action shots.

7.5/10"
"Already watched Mat Kilau. How to say? I can only give around 1 out of 5 stars. Mmg byk sgt kelemahan. Klau nk tgk skdar utk relax2, isi mase lapang or bg bdak2 tgk, blh la. Tp not recommended at all for action movies/dramas & history lovers. I likes action genre and history ++"
Malay klu chapter chat condemn org no 1. Hg tgk movie is not a documentary. He’s done a disclaimer. He’s got a movie he’s got to like. Bkn based on true story blackhawkdown last2 west jgk win apo. Suh west has a hero make a new Mat Kilau comparable to your taste tu a puih coat
"yang sepatutnya kau marahkan ialah how shitty the movie was made based on the legendary mat kilau. dialog cacat, cinematography kl gangster."
Defo not. i don’t watch movie much and mat kilau really is fine imho
For me this glare mat is normal and I tkde problem you ckp best sbb other people taste. Tpi I don’t understand the movie has an old dh kt movie ready to collect 100h brew skrg org nk censure. Msa tgh show tk fuss mcm this pulak.
not surprised to see mat kilau getting low ratings from people. i’ve said it before that the pacing was so off and the dialogue sounds pretentious in every way. you can make a patriotic/historical movie without it being as messy as it is.
"Thank you for your review. But you know how the effort to make the old historical to become a movie? That’s not easy to satisfy everyone, but for me Mat Kilau is the best Malay movie we can watch to remember the services of our previous heroes."
"Akhi, we nk sentap with warning, follow it Al-Kuliyyah TV3. More appropriate in such a ceremony of knowledge from Mat Kilau’s movie 

Ni ana advice for anta ya akhi. Don’t have a little Quranic verse in the movie, kite dh snapped. That’s the name less filling of the soul ya akhi"
Actually want to criticize mat glitter to like mat glitter okay. What movie doesn’t come to
"What a joke. Ko see movie kind of nk kene no soul art k? 

Since when does an art-spirited movie make money? If x a lot of rich art people 

It’s either They make it fun or They ride the sentiment. Mat Kilau is the latter"
"Aku selalu bagitau orang yang belum tengok Mat Kilau, kalau nak tengok Perhimpunan Agong UMNO versi filem... Tengoklah filem tu.

It’s a bad movie. Yang positive dari filem tu, Beto je."
"true! banyak bincang2 dari segi to expand knowledge in history this what historical movies should be, endless discussion. merdeka tak terjadi tanpa discussions. mat kilau is more like promoting culture w history but history is more fictional."
"Just watched MAT KILAU in netflix .  It was a nice movie to watch and get to learn who you are , where are you coming from, where should you stand and why Mat Kilau wanted save the land so badly, there is a lyrics stated in Negaraku . 4.5 cause the ending .. habis dah"
"Okay ja view each of them about the Mat Kilau, but if you’re more than doing your own movie"
Finally watched Mat Kilau on Netflix. Let’s just say I’m very glad I watched it and wasn’t swayed by the reviews from back home. Not to mention the scandal surrounding the movie that had nothing to do with the movie.
When the docks came back about Mat Kilau just noticed that this year there weren’t many sharing videos of independence ads to Malaysia Day. There’s just oneuu. Always meet you two three short movies
I rather watch Ratsasan (Tamil movie) for 6th time than watch Mat Kilau for 2nd time
First 10 mins of Mat Kilau is making me  how’d ya’ll finish this movie
"Since semalam Mat Kilau mula tayang kat Netflix, nampak makin banyak negative review lol. yaa that movie is such a meh. People were not exaggerating tho about the shaky camera. Character development almost none, and the story ends with the climax, no resolution."
"Lepas berbulan orang duk cerita Movie Mat Kilau ritu, harini baru dapat tengok lepas masuk Netflix le Aku jarang pergi wayang nanti for sure aku tidur"
I’m the only one to the drama/movie Mat Kilau time at the cinema. And when does free on Netflix still not be a no?
Mat Kilau movie rlly potray the reality of Melayu
"Who doesn’t like to see the movie mat glitter xpela.. Appetite of each... 

Tp ready to stamp the guy who likes that story as ""low IQ"" is more of a naaa coat..... 

Lek2 dahlew... indifferent"
"Mat Kilau is a bad movie. Sorry, not sorry."
Is the Mat Kilau movie good? It’s a movie. Has a specific appeal. Triggers some specific feelings. Does not really leave a lasting impression. Not the actors nor crew’s fault. The producer and director just have a specific mission. Was never meant a masterpiece.
"I think mat glitter should do a telemovie or movie near ASTRO first, seriously overrated. For me brother syamsul should’ve done a lot better than this."
"I’ll admit the Mat Kilau has a 6-7 over 10 storyline. But the acting and effort to produce such a movie ni power, can cover up to the weakness of this story. Many righteously just look at netflix for the sake of wanting to hit je uh"
"Mat Kilau, good movie if you’re watching it for the first time, but not going to repeat"
tiber so many dislike for mat kilau movie
Movie... Sparkle Mat.. rating=0
"Personally, I really don’t like the movie directed by Yusoff’s son because I’ve seen it once on TV, Munafik. Hahahaha so when it comes out Mat Kilau, skeptical when people say best crazy. Full timeline says it’s not best when it’s on Netflix. Fortunately, you didn’t spend money on the movie"
"Don’t compare it to outdoor movies, local movies too, sergeant hassan, even paskal. There’s an element of the same patriotic spirit without cringe dialogue & a messy plot. But the glitter is still crazy, just because of the turmoil. Try to push the nest & watch it with a neutral feeling. Still the same?"
"People see Mat Kilau near the movie because the hype of the duk people says best-best...

I went to the movies with my sister, I saw it. Wtf, not even worth the hype. Just an average movie with horrible fighting scene shoot..."
"Sooo mat glitter is it that bad? I read there’s a close TV, change another movie after 10, 20 and 30 mins."
"Sapa ke pengkritik movie tersohor di malaysia yg beria promote mat kilau tu? Now i really doubt his credibility.

Apa jadah sial kau rasa mat kilau ni cerita yg mantap gila? Kau takde taste ke?"
"There’s just a taste to watch movie mat glitter, let’s kids"
Take off the Mat Kilau near netflix.. For me this movie is overrated. Movie Air Force LG Best.
"Thanks Netflix for showing movie Mat Kilau.. with all the hype goin on, our family excited with this movie when it released.. we watch yesterday the whole family, and after 30 minutes of the movie, my mom literally zzzz....  it shows what…… (fill in the blanks)…."
The verse... Takpa Next Week tgk Elvis. to the point of no sbb... TGGU the movie appears d hotstar or Netflix last2 mat glitter appears kt Netflix first
like a Mat Kilau movie mat
Last night I watched Mat Kilau on Netflix hmmm I still don’t understand why people say the movie is the best
You dont like the idea of a comedian taking her tudung off to make a joke? Dont watch the video. You dont like an ethnonationalist Shamsul Yusof movie? Don’t watch Mat Kilau. Spare yourself the unnecessary stress that you’re putting your body into.
Also why do I think lakonan Fattah Amin in Mat Kilau is better than everyone else especially Mat Kilau himself. Mmg satu expression je the entire movie
"Instead of making a Mat Kilau, it’s better to make a movie for other characters, such as tok elephant to tok beard to dato maharajalela to.. directors in Malaysia don’t be lazy to do research.."
"Tak sukanya warga twitter yang ""lepas 10 min bukak mat kilau dekat netflix, terus tutup""

Taktau lah what is your intention nak cakap macam tu. Then add on, ""sesuai lah untuk melayu""

Haah memang kau terpaling tengok semua movie pun. Cerita dah lama, orang dah hype lama."
"Day 509 since the making of  
FOTD: Currently watching Mat Kilau (again) over on netflix..and yeah it’s no wonder peeps don’t vibe with it. It’s a mess. It’d be a good movie if it actually resonated with the people but as you see...there are some that still-"
Malay but Muslim. I don’t believe in Mat Kilau movies
"People say that Mat Kilau stories are adaptations, if you want facts, you should read history books. but now his issue is not just historical fact, but plot, character development, cinematography. one more thing, it’s not because there is high expectation, but this movie is popular just because it’s Malay"
"Finally got to watch Mat Kilau via netflix. Well, i must say good movie for a Malay historical genre n of coz the star studded cast. Didnt know tis Mat Kilau is legit."
"After watching the scene against Mat Kilau, I conclude that only deep people can accept the story from this alarming POV. I really want to relax and watch the movie, I’m getting more and more anxious!"
"RM55 per month for example. Divide by how many movies and dramas there are. Plus, don’t you want to face Mat Kilau every day? It’s true that the souls of Malay warriors will die later. LOL"
Who doesn’t like to watch the movie Mat Kilau must jump over the school fence during history subject time
"Tolak tepi mat kilau best ka tak best...tapi all this mat kilau tweets making mat kilau trending again on twitter timeline. Syok la marketing team mat kilau. Best ka tak best ka, akhirnya nama movie mat kilau ni viral dan trending juga.

Mat Kilau 1 - Netizen 0"
Up back Mat Kilau’s tweet since Netflix came out. You can enter the history of this movie. Heartbreaking success.
"I think even if I comment, Dh is good. That’s where you get cursed

I really believe in Mat Kilau movie Mat Kilau"
"I think I’m so busy cursing British hamun that I don’t even notice what people are criticizing.

But his camera is indeed dizzy."
"Agreed.
There are woke malays just hate anything abt the Malays. And nowadays it’s woke to insult the Malay movies esp. mega box office movie Mat Kilau. Perhaps jealousy."
"What’s the point of arguing about Mat Kilau for months without end. You’re not the one who turns into a stunt instead of fattah amin doing martial arts in the movie, wakakak"
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film. From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot. What do you get? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive, I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing. That’s why during the premiere he brought in the movie reviewer."
mid movie Mat Kilau
It’s bad that the luster got stuck hahaha luckily I never felt like watching it from the start. A movie that only caters to the Malays indeed if you watch this movie for sure I’d leave my ass after 10 mins into the movie
Showing Mat Kilau kat Netflix dah jadi the movie to show to a large number of people/relatives yg came to your home so you don’t have to interact with them
"Just need to add on how  is. The note that was given to the villagers for taxation,ends with “God save the queen” . During 1892 “mat kilau movie setting” the ruler of england was King George V.  Small details Mat Kilaur’s also."
I don’t know why people don’t like Mat Kilau? The movie is so good and the fact the movie is based on true story
"Many cytros give bad reviews about Mat Kilau,

or Mat Kilau movies that don’t meet other people’s tastes and expectations

to me, mat kilau is a very good movie

want to say five stars, no,
four stars is enough,"
"This mat kilau story focuses on the character development of mat kilau’s friends

the camera does not shake,
who said shake, is a liar,

the camera has a lot of close ups to martial arts techniques, and the action is fast but can still be captured and understood

no problem with movie audio"
I watched mat kilau yesterday on netflix. As expected. Hence i rarely watch malay movies at cinema.
Actually Syamsul already admit beberapa  mistakes dalam movie Mat Kilau in his press conference. And he didn’t expect the networth will 100mil.
"Yesterday I watched the movie Mat Kilau with my family. I’m just my wife, I skip making coffee, playing games aha. Bored!

It’s good that I wasn’t fooled by the movie ""review"" from twidder.

Remember the last Malay movie I saw at the cinema, Mimpi Dilaila.. ughh how stupid was that movie!"
"movie mat kilau time stamped 1:48:51, when kilau got the sword, what did he do to rest, because wahid was the opponent hahahahaha"
What does it have to do with liking Mat Kilau and getting it back? Even the movie is relaxing. A lot of people hesitate when watching LGBT movies because they are afraid of reality. but Mat Kilau film itself also wants to relate to reality. its just a fvcking movie. chill
remind cite biography. even though there is absolutely no mention of the main character. well put the title of the movie ’Ini Tanah Kami’. not ’Mat Kilau’. Awang’s character stands out from the main character
"Mat Kilau cinematography and its continuity could be a lot, A LOT better. The script and wording doesn’t really scream quality movie. Limited character development. 

I mean.. I enjoyed Ejen Ali the Movie much more than that."
"Naturally, it’s a blockbuster movie.

Imagine a Mat Kilau film only 100k people watched. Maybe 1-10% don’t like it, haters.

We think a lot of people like this movie because only 1-10k say it’s boring/trash.

But if 6 million people watch it. Already 600k said this movie is rubbish."
"First of all, I think your IQ is very high, Syamsul uses someone
""figure"" to promote the religion of Islam and don’t forget that Mat Kilau is someone who is fluent in tassawur, that’s why Syamsul included that ""REACH"" element in this film.
Can this film be misinterpreted in Malay?"
"The ones who comment & review like turning away from the taste of the movie director with the hope that Mat Kilau is in line with the films that can enter the oscar... phuuiii

That’s how the man who supposedly has everything in his head is the greatest on social media.

I don’t know, just look at the teaser"
Even the movie article wants to fight. It’s sad to see Malays like this. Why didn’t the British say that Malays have to unite. Even the movie article is already noisy
"Haha.. byk komen -ve watching mat kilau @ netflix. I x like it btw. Ive seldom watch malay movie pon, to be exact. Syamsul knows his crowd. He knows to tackle them. Thats why his movie jarang x juta². Ppl will have diff opinion."
"Had to watch Air Force the movie and the visuals were so bad! Still dizzy.. the story for me is best based on Malaysia has a film industry, the same goes to Mat Kilau.. well no Mat Kilaur what we can’t compare our local films with films from other countries. Malaysia is fine"
"Not finished with this Mat Kilau article?
Change the topic. I still can’t understand why the movie Thor - Love and Thunder can’t go to Malaysian cinemas."
"I would also like to evaluate the Mat Kilau movie. But later. If you want to go to the movies, it’s a waste of money if the movie isn’t the best"
"there are hundreds who disagree w you. If you don’t like it, fine. 
Is it necessary to put others’ preference down? 
People harp on Parasite & make comparison Parasite vs Mat Kilau. Heck. I fast forwarded the movie to d ending cos it bored me. 
Did I make fun of the Academy? nope"
"hahahha but it’s really Mat Kilau and not the best, if you want to mess around in the middle of a movie at the cinema during the day"
"All people have different genes, so movie preferences may vary. IMO, the film Mat Kilau is not at the level of a trash film so Zhaf does not swear. Most of the films that Zhaf criticizes seem to the eyes of ordinary viewers to say that the film is rubbish."
"Can withstand the bad review of Mat Kilau. I didn’t see it. Shuk saw yesterday. But I came out of the room and asked him what movie he was watching because I heard howling screams and felt nervous. I was like ""What movie is that? Chaos really sounds. Do you have to shout if you want to talk?"""
"Tonight I want to have a movie night with Fitrie to watch the Mat Kilau. I’m just looking at the doc dang, he’s busy"
So kalau tengok mat kilau dekat netflix tak boleh condemn ke?biasa je movie ni aku tengok..kbai
"From the beginning when I watched Mat Kilau, I said that the story was not the best. There are so many over scenes that it becomes clingy.

The best Malay movie is Razor."
Perhaps prev good and critical movies people don’t associate with him because he doesn’t promote the movie too much like how he promotes Mat Kilau?
"what he is actually dissatisfied with is if the actual good and critical movies don’t get the response and link him because of the good ratings on the luster mat. This is a Mat Kilaur of opinion, open for debate and discussion"
"This Inspector Lim from the time of the movie Lieutenant Adnan until the movie Mat Kilau, he is on the colonialist side"
"The queen died between Aug. 31 and Sept. 16, two very important dates for Malaysian nationalism, in a country still debating its independence narrative and colonial history.

Just recently, an anti-British colonial era movie ’Mat Kilau’ made over 100m ringgit in the cinemas."
"It’s okay, I looked at the Mat Kilau, the empty one turned away from history.. turned away from movie critics, what’s the Mat Kilaur. Just enjoy it. Woke is uncertain"
"Citer Mat Kilau ni teruk sebenarnya.

Skrip, plot, lakonan, semua level kelab teater kat uni. Tak tkesan langsung tgk scene yg spatutnya rasa sedih atau marah. Fight scene pun silat dh nampak cam Wing Chun.

Sesiapa yg ckp movie ni best tak patut bg pendapat pasal any movie ever."
"MAT KILAU im not condem but my view of that movie, 2.5/5 star.. tah banyak sgt eliment yg tak kena. Tgk la sendiri..karang ckp lebih netizen kecam."
"I think Mat Kilau is just an ordinary film.
Turn off the cameraman, he has Parkinson’s and then the time fight scene."
"You don’t care, the movie is understandable and respected. Heck, I’ve even criticized the Mat Kilau movie.

But with endless sentences ""it’s suitable for Malays"" why? Are you not Malay?

Are you saying you’re not like most Malays?
Ptuih"
"I like to cry when I watch the movie, 5 minutes into the mat I was crying"
Mat Kilau has many shortcomings in his storyline. His dialogue and acting are also amazing. But the timing is right when many are thirsty for this kind of movie - the strongest impact is on the kids - to inculcate the feeling of patriotism.
"They are using Mat Kilau’s name for the movie, he’s the main character, so I think the least they could do is add in a little bit history to show that he’s “Mat Kilau”. I’m not talking about 100% sejarah, tapi at least I think should ada distinctive scene yang based on history."
"not blaming yall for saying Mat Kilau movie is bad,
but why tf some of yall gotta make fun of SyamsulYusof and hate him for no reason?? mad respect cuz he put a lot of effort in the movie and he didnt even hurt yall, chill tf out
yall need to cope"
"Mat Kilau cakap bunyi puisi 

Cerita Disney cakap nyanyi-nyanyi 

Pada aku movie tu biasa2 je, lebih kepada propaganda. Tapi cerita mat saleh pun banyak propaganda jugak.

So itu perkara normal.

Yang tak normal cuma camera works yang serupa lalat, terbang pusing2."
"Movie Mat Mat Kilau is easy to understand and digest. Direct to the point..I think the presentation is important..if you want to understand this history, you have to relax. If it’s very serious, people will run away and not want to see it again.."
"Grant, I think that if you want to promote it as one of the movies that promote martial arts and the Malay psyche, then that would be appropriate. Even Bunohan is more appropriate than Mat Kilau for me even though it’s not really an action movie, but more of a drama."
"Syamsul Yusof doesn’t even want to make a good movie. But he wants to make a movie that exploits this theme. Gangsterism (KL Gangster), Witchcraft & Dark Arts (Munafik), Malay history (Mat Kilau)."
"Done, check out the Mat Kilau on Netflix. Why netflix because there are small children, it’s not appropriate to bring it to the puppet stage.

Mat Kilau review:
Everything is ok, the story line (it should be based on a true story, right), the color of the film is ok.

However, there are some drawbacks..."
"Okay, dah tengok Mat Kilau kat Netflix. Basically memang movie untuk budak-budak la. Yang simple minded."
"Mat Kilau movie is trash.. 
That’s the tweet."
"Our people are indeed toxic (liver problems). Give a comment Mat Kilau, it’s the first time to do it. It’s not like this is his 100th historical movie. Each comment is like an expert in movies. For constructive comments. Relax already."
The Mat Kilau is actually good. Mat Salleh has many other films that are very popular except the blockbuster one.
"It’s only been a few months since the last month for the film to come out, now it’s available on Netflix. Lol"
"What people (initially) think are the reasons mat kilau is no 1: 
awesome cinematography, soundtrack, great cgi and fight choreography.

Why its really no 1 in Malaysia:
Malaysians crave movies depicting local figures as inspiring heroes."
"It’s interesting to read the comments on the film Mat Kilau, version of Netflix viewers."
"Honestly, I enjoyed watching Mat Kilau in theater with my family. But... yes, the sound, camera and script thing mmng . His sound effect is so loud and over the top that even my 3-year-old nephew doesn’t even notice. He was angry until the movie was over, he didn’t disturb other people"
"Mat kilau is a bad film/movie

Which colonizer wants to tell what is the weakness of the country/nation he colonized? Besides in Mat Kilau.

Never ending from the beginning ""kaymu maylayu berpeciah baylah.""

Cringed madly."
"Conclusion, Mat Kilau is a bad but good fictional popcorn movie. Kena stop movie ni sebagai filem sejarah coz too many unclear facts, clearly. Lastly, it’s kilau time."
"I’ve seen the Mat Kilau movie that day. But because of many comments after entering Netflix before, I want to enter the scene too.

Yes! It’s not the best! As a comparison, I can say that Air Force The Movie is better even though some people say that the action is lacking. But at least the hype is sky high."
"Sepanjang tgk mat kilau ni, tried to keep an open mind tapi can’t help to compare this movie to certain historical movie dari indonesia mcm kartini, bumi manusia etc. Indonesian punya standard lain sungguh"
"For movies, everybody has different taste when it comes to a movie. Some say that Mat Kilau is the best, some say it’s almost, some say it’s not the best. If you don’t like it, why are you still watching? And yeah, one more thing, cursing doesn’t even give us power, it looks like we’re still stupid"
"I don’t even feel like looking at it. I know enough about his history, even in that movie he worked out a little bit to become that tall. Do you want to be distracted by the movie, the one who is criticized can’t be criticized, it is you who are distracted by the Malay language, that syamsul is eating a good steak every day."
"i guess that was just personal opinion bcs i assumed by watching clips/films back then, i thought orang dulu didn’t talk like THAT ahahahah, to me it was just cringy  as i was hoping Mat Kilau to be an extraordinary movie for Malaysians"
The one who condemns the luster is trying to make a movie to see
"It’s wrong to say that our film doesn’t get support, while you yourself say that our film (Mat Kilau kilau) is for millions. Of course, the majority of our people support our movie :)"
"yes, I know that some will be like ’mat kilau, okay what, at least it’s different from other movies, which is fun to tell about love or gangsters etc’ yes, that is indeed undeniable, but all this critic & review means that there is more room for films Malaysia to improve"
"I just finished Mat Kilau today, the movie is fine, it can be 5/10, it’s bland for me but I understand the message of fighting spirit that you want to convey"
For me Mat Kilau not a good movie but worth watching.
"apa lah masalah semua dengan cerita mat kilau ni. orang malaysia ni condemn je kerja. cerita air force pun awak condemn. 

awak je lah buat movie. 

tak suka tak apa lah, tak kisah. duduk je diam diam."
Bagus Mat Kilau borak Space ni. Meyakinkan aku untuk tak tengok the movie
"Returning from Amimek’s house, I went to the night market in the mountain with heavy rain, waiting for the satay to cook, then continue that night to see the glittering Mat Kilau of the neighboring houses. It’s good to continue 1 more movie. All types of vein pain"
"; There are so many people condemning the Mat Kilau movie that they just watched on Netflix that they feel like they have a low IQ level. Lol, you’re confused, you have a high iq, you can go on the road with your opinion. I woke up very quickly."
"I want to argue about Mat Kilau. this movie is subjective. if you don’t like it, tweet once and then just shut up"
The Mat Kilau is average and doesn’t really wow. But at least we know that this Malay hero was great. I don’t agree with the camera shaking.
Tajuk movie Mat Kilau but we learned nothing about Mat Kilau except he’s a flashy Malay warrior.
"I admit there are flaws. But there are still many good things. So, to those who have reviewed the Mat Kilau. Continue to support other Malay movies and give more reviews. Don’t stop at the Mat Kilau because it’s viral"
"Who here is willing to pay rm25 to watch Malay movies?? Haha, I’m ready to watch kimchi for you at the cinema, you know...how much I enjoy Malay movies. From this Mat Kilau film I see the improvement of our Malay films."
"Malaysia day, Mat Kilau movie on netflix.
Once again, there are many people who review Mat Kilau. It’s worse for people. Be ready to say ""maybe I have high expectations"".
Bro, people have already reviewed the movie many times, you can expect it. I’m not bitter because he gave his opinion"
"Mat Kilau movie really good..I suggest watch it,you can in Netflix."
Open netflix right now to see what the hype is all about. 15 minutes into the movie and then watch Shippuden. Hahahaha
"This is like a very good time to watch mat kilau coz the queen just die and the movie shows how bad the colonizer british treat our country/people,, how they tried to profit of our natural resources"
"Tgk Mat Kilau reminds me of RRR... the format is the same... intensity, background music, action are all the best, only the shaking camera part is a little less... But still a good movie.."
"I’m glad it’s on netflix, people are fighting over this movie"
"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix. A very decent movie I must say. 3.5/5
His martial arts part is the best!!!
The dialogue is solid, piercing the heart!!!
Cinematography can do better!!!"
What is this mat kilau movie… 10 mins in and i gave up. Look if i wanted to listen to a ceramah i can easily look for any misogynist Ustaz ceramah on youtube alright?
Let’s see how it Mat Kilau. I feel like watching an English movie but I don’t know what to watch
"bro, he has already collected millions from this Mat Kilau movie. people don’t even care about your comment"
Why do those who watch Mat Kilau on Netflix turn away and curse this Msia movie? This must be the type of interest in the heathen Marvel movies.
Haha  mat kilau tu appeal to masses. Popular but doesn’t mean to movie is that good. Average saja
"Alas, this sparkling mat movie is actually a Beto mat movie"
"Now why do you have to rely on Zhaf to have a movie comment eh? I don’t know when he trashed all the movies on your thumbnail for clickbait. Not creative.

And Mat Kilau is directed by Syamsul Yusuf. It can be said that this story is just a popcorn movie. Not a top-tier kinda thing"
"Not a fan of Mat Kilau but atleast i have something to watch on netflix with my parents. Instead of english movie with ‘awkward scene’ or never ending cerita hantu melayu, rempit movie, etc.."
Am i the only who wasn’t really impressed with mat kilau movie
"Many people say that this film is the best, ready to watch it 2-3 times. when you enter netflix, many people say it’s not the best"
"But sis, that’s the struggle of our fighters from the age of luck until the end. Their main struggle is to fight for the dignity of religion, nation and homeland. For me the script was realistic, maybe it could be completely interesting if the movie editing technique is great"
"I think, people use the Mat Kilau title just to attract the audience. Because the glittery character doesn’t really stand out in this movie. This movie should be titled ""destroying the British in ulu tebeling""."
"After watching the Mat Kilau movie.

The camera is not relaxing. Left right front back. Part opponent to jetty to tgh bersilat to. X relax eh.

It’s time to chat with a lot of people, it’s time to change shots every 2 seconds. Eye pain, loss of focus. Suddenly the drone shot, go back in for a close up shot."
"It’s already on Netflix, I still don’t want to watch Mat Kilau. During the first week of the movie, I chose to watch the Elvis movie. It’s not because I’m not patriotic, but I want to see the best movie."
"It’s true that each has an interest, but if the Mat Kilau, the praise is soaring, but when it comes to the Air Force, he says cringe, it’s a bit suss. This is my opinion as a casual movie goer."
"thank you Netflix for bringing Mat Kilau to my home TV. proven I did not waste my money/time to go to cinema, I slept through the movie (thankfully in the comfort of my bed), not my cup of tea."
Gelak besar Shoojit Sircar kalau tengok movie Mat Kilau ni.
I know agree to disagree. Why are people so angry about the movie Mat Kilau? Chill already. Everyone has their own opinion
"daripada korang layan mat kilau tu baik korang layan Paloh, a good pseudo historical movie by adman salleh. albeit the editing was quite poor i don’t mind as long as the actors paid good acts."
"Ni citer Mat Kilau or the documentary History of the school syllabus, right?? I swear this movie script is bad preaching."
Maybe the problem there is a lack of public promotion. We’ve never heard of both films meanwhile Mat Kilau is all out promoting the film. No wonder people claim this film is overrated
"For me movie Mat Kilau x best

But...if people like it...it’s ok
It’s okay if people don’t like me

Preference memasing...byr foreign tickets²

Don’t disagree... it’s bullshit"
"BRO MAT KILAU WAS SO HYPED BRO, GREAT ASS MOVIE"
"Same concept dgn marvel. Adakah dgn physics teory dlm marvel buat semua 100% explore physics? But people talk bout it.

Same as this I never saw people discussing about mat kilau on social media beside textbook history. After this movie, people talk about mat kilau and silat"
"I haven’t seen an action movie in a long time, watching Mat Kilau is terrifying"
"Watching Mat Kilau rn. Half way through watching, I still don’t understand what people are hyping about this movie"
"We watched Mat Kilau tonight on Netflix.

The first comment from mom after 15 minutes of the movie starting.

That’s the husband @missfazura right?

Amboi mom 

#matkilau #awang #netflix #selamatharimalaysia"
"I suspect that director Mat Kilau has never read the Brandstory book.

Not following the correct movie principle."
"Mat kilau tak best, byk boleh improve lah kalau nak buat historical movie. Nasib dkt netflix boleh berenti and sambung2, if dkt wayang mungkin dah tido . One two jaga and dukun tu mmg best, i admit."
"The concept is the same as Marvel & Multiverse. Multiverse is theory and Marvel is fiction too. But he has encouraged his fans to explore more physics and multiverse theory.

Just like a Mat Kilau. Historical figure Mat Kilau. This film is a fiction that will encourage people to explore history"
"My adik is so excited to watch Mat Kilau. Hence, I let him watch the movie tonight"
"Dah apahal tiba2 kecoh balik Mat Kilau ni haha. Cakapla x kena selera, ulaskan dah la, nak heret sekali reviewer yg suka movie tu apahal la? Aduyaiii."
literally watched mat kilau for the first 15 mins and it felt so much like watching a movie for an assignment
"I mistakenly watched a video about Mat Kilau film. I can’t watch the scene where there are machetes, shooting shooting... stabbing everyone.

Throbbing. Fast!"
"Lek zhaf, dia ingat pandangan dia tuh orang nak demgar, aku pun takdelah hype movie mat kilau and kurang sikit mvie ni, but takdelah bantah pandangan orang yg suka, ibarat kau makan nasi lemak cheese leleh pastu kau kata org yg tk makan tuh bullshit, haha fckoff"
Tonight’s movie of choice is Mat Kilau!
I still like the language in the movie Merong Mahawangsa compared to Mat Kilau
"Sis kept looking at twitter, searching about Mat Kilau after watching not even half of the movie. It’s just a minimum bear, it’s just that Malaysia hasn’t come out with a concept story like this for a long time, hence, people are a bit overhyped (a lot actually). Ok, this is the end of the story, sis, comment back even if nobody asks"
Many people watch Netlfix to comment on the Mat Kilau movie. The 89 million look at it all ok. strange.
sape review movie mat kilau ni best….can we talk….
Did he praise the Mat Kilau film that day?
"agree..this movie is good, this rise is 10x from the Mat Kilau..it just melts all the hairs that are there"
"It’s ok, the Mat Kilau story, I don’t want it to be so bad, I’m ready to make a thread like this. Malay people really like to put down Malay people , there are many Korean stories that are overhyped and there is no plaque for the Malays to comment until they make a thread. Lol you are the best at watching movies"
Sempena hri malaysia. Ak marathon tgk movie stu hri. Mat Kilau. Government. Naayak. My heart is yours.
"Just looked at the Mat Kilau. Just watch and enjoy. Too lazy to comment. A lot of people have become movie critics lately. The cinematography, the script. Not my thing."
"Haha, org twitter kondem mat kilau terus macam buruk terus movie tu.  Hahaha.  Teknikal movie tu memang tak cun pon, tapi tu lah, idea movie tu aku tetap sokong lah."
"I hit the Mat Kilau, half of the movie I lost to the Mat Kilau, I understand it myself. Hahahaha now I’m wondering how there are people so many times in wayang? Hahahahahahahahaha."
"The gang just watched the movie Mat Kilau on Netflix, are you busy trying to give a review? lol"
Fil has been feeling a bit under a weather today and asked me to record mat kilau on netflix he didnt want to miss our movie nite ok postpone ok
"like this

try to not look at mat kilau as merely a ""movie"" that brings fictional content to the table"
"Too many critics on Mat Kilau
But honestly, I don’t think it’s a very bad movie, it can be a bonus to feel proud with enthusiasm. But air force srsly his vibes are different. 2 times aq usha and both aq nangeh. I’ve tried it many times but I still can’t feel it"
"Precisely.. Cameraworks yg gegar2 tu sebenarnya utk buat penonton feel situasi dlm movie tu.. And I really don’t have any problem with the camerawork either in mat kilau and air force the movie, but still.. I understand, they need to improve of those tiny errors in their movies"
Mat Kilau! it’s a historical movie that’s really good and it’s out on our netflix~ really recomend it if you have the chance to watch it~!
Watching Mat Kilau is like watching a Tamil movie. martial arts fighting is normal but he has sound over nau
"When talking about Mat Kilau, people must want to know for example:
-Who is the Mat Kilau?
-How is his life?
-Who is his teacher?

The best example of Merong Mahawangsa movie. Character building is solid.

It’s just that the technology, the budget, it’s not suitable & the history of Merong is much more complex."
"Comparing historical movie vs Sinetron. Sinetron is only for tv and most of them are low budget, but this Mat Kilau with more budget and base on historical event but looks like sinetron"
Depend dgn situasi scene. Try to watch the transformers or any other action movies.. Byk teknik camera gegar masa action scenes. This is what they applied in mat kilau and air force the movie.
"Many people say that this Mat Kilau movie has a lot of excitement during the fight scene....sorry, Air Force the Movie, I’m having a headache knowing the camera movement"
"done with no Mat Kilau. even lambertt hahah. if you see it at the movies, it’s best. but that’s it. My son wants to put mano here, but he’s busy at home when people watch movies."
"I’ll stick with my decision first... Mat Kilau, a good story, I rate it high but it doesn’t make it into my all time favorite movie laaa (Malaya)"
"i will say it here bcos my fren love it.  but Mat Kilau is a horrible movie in term of the writing, directing & camerawork. But the casts is amazing with so little thing they can work with."
"Mat Kilau’s movie is bad, here is criticism with netflix kids... the most high taste movie"
Apsal laaa who tweets and cites that Mat Kilau.. a western film that doesn’t make sense you can plak accept and praise melamb.. for me it’s not bad la malay movie is already as good as this..
"""Peh Mat Kilau on Netflix ah""

Then I opened it to watch the tmnt animated movie hahaha I wasn’t interested after watching the trailer that day anyway."
The first time I watched Zhaf’s movie review video was because I wanted to know if the movie Orphan First Kill was okay. hmm sorry The original video is there. Many people should be disappointed that Mat Kilau’s review is beautiful but the reality is... hmm it sucks. my2cents.
"Ni bukan masalah honest review, tapi masalah personal tapi project dkt movie mat kilau.

Mcm sial."
"Haha, after it came out on netflix, people just realized that it was overhyped. Maybe it’s because the reviewers all give high ratings that it’s overhyped. It’s not that I don’t want to support Malay movies, but in terms of the plot, the movie is normal. For me air force is still the best"
Idk if my taste is what genre this film belongs to but Mat Kilau is a masterpiece of Malaysian film!
I saw mat kilau on netflix with the same reaction in the movie that I watched about 5 times.. hahaha I don’t understand the people who make the film tell me about the story of mat kilau.. hahaha sian eh korg
"I seldom review a film on sosial media but here goes Mat Kilau is 0.2/10. I had nothing against our forfathers sacrifice. 

But it was a overhype movie, the dialog/narrative was poor and there was no orang Pahang slang."
"Look at Mat Kilau, even bitter. I understand that movie very well."
Just finished watching Mat Kilau on netflix... a very good movie it’s great... can skip the stabbing part
"if you want to watch Malay movies related to history, watch puteri gunung ledang, 29 februari and lieutenant adnan. please don’t waste your time on mat kilau. please."
mat kilau is already on netflix.. i don’t know when to watch this movie
There is a lot of dialogue that is quite piercing in the story of Mat Kilau. A very good local movie for sure
"Luckily I don’t see Mat Kilau glitter again, ok there is a movie of the night"
"Betul, if the movie had expired regardless kita dah download pun still cannot watch. Tapi mat kilau en, might be there on the list for a while insha Allah sempat kalau nak habiskan hahaha"
"I love seeing people commenting on Mat Kilau that it is now on Netflix. Hari tu I cakap Mat Kilau tak best ada yg bash I, ckp I tak patriotic. Lol it has nothing to do w/ patriotism, mmg the movie needs major revamping before I can say it’s acceptable. Dah la tak ikut sejarah"
I need some more movies like Mat Kilau!
"I’m not that well-versed in story telling but it’s not wrong to be critical sbb I love this kind of movies being made more into our industri seni, lgi pulak pasal nk beri mesej baik mcm citer mat kilau of course la nk at least plotline tak caca-merba ye dok?"
"Movie Mat Kilau is okay, good try. Its a soap opera about Malay warriors. I want to make it like Ip Man but the cinematography fighting scene is like hauk. Kipidap Malay movie #idopmelayu"
but if anyone wants to make a body story please cast fattah amin his action scene in Mat Kilau film is really good
"mat kilau is not as good as yall said it was, i mean the dialogue is disappointing as i expected classic language e.g.  pramlee’s movie, the color grading does not fit the setting of the film, fighting choreography okay cun tapi camera tak relax"
"What a rubbish production of this Mat Kilau movie. The cinematography is over the top, the fight sequence is clumsy, the plot of the movie is like spongebob. Lang Buana is the best, damn it"
Baru habis layan Mat Kilau kat Netflix. Kalau takde Beto pishang beb. Charisma A++. Special mention goes to Fattah. Best performance yet. Jgn tanya aku What i think bout the movie. I wanna make something worth 100 mili too
"Btw, I don’t watch mat kilau on netflix because my mom said it’s crazy that she watches movies. What’s wrong? At the beginning of the scene, he was jumping between the logs, but the logs had already been released before he jumped. I lost my expectation with this movie. The last fight was good, the guerilla suddenly ambushed 10 people like that"
"None of Mat Kilau’s history ada. Mat kilau is a catfish untuk org tgk. Its more of a movie to make Malays realise ‘this is ur land, dont ciken out and defend it like what our forefathers did for us.’"
"Many people should say that the Mat Kilau movie is the best, it is indeed the best, it doesn’t make me cry it’s sad"
"Mat Kilau is out on netflix, I’m tired of watching movies right @Mr_IzharIsmail"
Luckily it didn’t look Mat Kilau in the movie
The movie Mat Kilau can be seen at #Netflix today
I’m sure a lot of people will be disappointed with the Mat Kilau film and wonder why people are so hyped about it
"""It’s not the best la cite, it sounds like it’s over"" my bro to mat the luster of the movie"
Biasa biasa je movie mat kilau ni
"I love history. I love movies. But sorry to say, Mat Kilau is meh.
I’ve written a few things that don’t make sense, but I don’t want to share them all on Twitter, there’s so many.
Malaysian directors and team need to watch more international movies to learn details."
"I just installed this Mat Kilau a minute ago, it’s like this throughout the movie, will there be something interesting later? lazy to waste time"
"Movies like puteri gunung ledang, lieutenant adnan and embun are better to watch than mat kilau"
"Things that people may think are unnecessary but I want to change in Mat Kilau, right, during the early scene of the fighting chase to introduce the character, instead of covering the faces of Wahid, Awang & Brahim, it’s better to cover the faces of Mat Kilau and then reveal them. The title of the movie is Mat Kilau"
Rewatching mat kilau with the famz... honestly this is the only Malay movie that we can watch together
Lopek giler movie mat kilau
Why do I think the film Mat Kilau has a very ’bright’ picture? And the cinematography...
"Harini movie Mat Kilau kluar kat Netflix. Sorry ar nk ckp, aku je ke yg rasa crita nie overrated? Aku suka lagi Puteri Gunung Ledang. Awal2 movie mat kilau pun aq dah start tanya, zaman dulu ada inner tudung dah ke? Alahai..."
mama as a history teacher said something wrong w mat kilaau the movie
"I was sitting infront tv almost 2 hours, watching Mat Kilau and yes it was a good movie. Lama tak tngok movie melayu yg powerful in every bits it has."
SALAAM SEJAHTERA TENGOH THE MOVIE MAT KILAU IS SUCH A FIRE FOR THE MALAY FIGHTERS IN MALAYSIA TODAY IS MALAYSIA DAY FORGET THE MOVIE PERJUNG MAT KILAU JUST SHOUTING MALAYSIA CAN BE ROBBED IN THE COLONIES THE MALAYSIAN PEOPLE ARE OPPRESSED
"It’s true when they say, ""good or bad publicity, publicity is still publicity"".

Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix. Tbh, it didn’t live up to its hype. Bar the politics, this movie was boring and cringey. Storyline was flat. 

Can’t believe this was actually compared to Ip Man."
Just watched mat kilau in netflixxx . Huwaaa the movie came mase EOP and I just want to see it huwaaa
watch the movie Mat Kilau with his beloved wife
"Have you seen the movie Mat Kilau yet? It’s out on Netflix today. If so, it’s good to raise the flag at half-mast"
"the biggest mistake coming from filem mat kilau yg paling visible was the fact that NO ONE use loghat pahang throughout the whole movie, especially when it was set at jerantut like come on now"
Wow Mat Kilau has entered Netflix. I think the movie with the most and fastest quotes on Netflix
rewatching Mat kilau daddiest movie of all time
"midnight movie for today: Mat Kilau
finally got to see...I like Awang & Wahid"
"Mat kilau in Indonesia does not get media coverage like any Indo movie that enters Malaysia!! The Malaysian media always supports every Indo work that enters Malaysia, but the media in Indo does not do the same for Malaysian works..."
Where can I find the Mat Kilau movie online?
"Air Force The Movie = Rm27 million (still showing)
Film Mat Kilau = Rm97 million
Abang Long Fadhil’s movie = Rm10 million (still showing)

Total = Rm134 million

Who says Malaysians don’t support Malaysian Films. What’s important is the best film, the promotion has to be top notch!"
I hope you don’t lose the luster like you do in brsilat. But watching air force the movie feels the sacrifice of our soldiers for the sake of the country. The sense of sacrifice that we hope is our own is not always possible. .. the ideal is that the character dies.
"Air Force, the movie is really hyped, it’s like a Mat Kilau finish. Jlan Cita is the best. X cliché, fighting hard.. fighting hard. The path of ambition is crazy. It feels like the sacrifice of a military hero.. There are only one or two characters that stand out. Wlupn core cita psai Rock ng Mantis."
"Mat Kilau was my first malay movie after more than 10 years (the last time i watched malay movie was ombak rindu )

After watching Mat Kilau, istg i would never go to cinema just to waste my money for the local movies"
"I was crazy skeptical when I booked to see ATMOS. But, to my own surprise, the opening was awesome. Like. Ooooommmmgggggg. I’m in love. Either I didn’t watch Mat Kilau or this movie is awesome. I do not know. But I rate 5 .

My younger sister is so upset with that one character that she is shaking her chair"
"Mat kilau and airforce the movie supposed to feature an elite group of people, tactical in thinking and well versed in methods to dispose of enemies. However both movies had its climactic final fight taking place in an open field. I would like to understand the rationale of this."
"What’s the political message behind this new movie, just like Mat Kilau?"
honestly malaysia should just focus on this kind of movies  mat kilau  air force
"It’s kinda ironic that the Mat Kilau movie goes on about how bad the British were, but then it preaches Malay nationalism which is a byproduct of Britain’s failure to properly assimilate the non-malays with the indigenous Malay population."
"after the hyped movie Mat Kilau, Pahang’s heroes against the British, Pahang finally flew the flag at half-mast in honor of the death of the British Empire."
You should watch the movie about Mat kilau and you’ll see what’s the big problem
People are tired of making Mat Kilau movies against colonialists. The movie is ready to break the screening record... But there are also a few Malaysians who still lick the ass of the former colonialists. Really funny!
"I want to ask a little, the one who is interested in the Mat Kilau movie reference, don’t you study History at school? After watching the movie, will you know about Mat Kilau and the battle against oppressors? If this is the case, just abolish the History subject and replace it with the Movies subject!"
So that the audience of the movie Mat Kilau wakes up from daydreaming...
Don’t think... even the fact of the film Mat Kilau is deceiving.
"Like no meaning, the story has a Mat Kilau and becomes a movie. Still mourning for the queen"
"The thing.. that’s the purpose of the movie, from people who don’t know about Mat Kilau to know. I won’t watch that movie if I don’t take note of all his sacrifices..."
"Lps mat kilau, many people spread hate towards british for colonizing malaysia and scooping up all the earth’s produce. But.. How bou Japanese? Is it because the movie ""embun"" doesn’t top like a Mat Kilau? In conclusion we can’t erase history but why bother until you want to play racist?"
"The one who said that is gobloq. Ignore it.

A lot of people watch Mat Kilau because this is one of the film makers’ efforts to build a movie about history after a long time. The effort is pretty good.

We also study hero Mat Kilau in school. Therefore, many people come to watch."
It looks like this anti-British sentiment is different from the post-season of the Mat Kilau movie. It is appropriate for the government to pull Malaysia out of the Commonwealth of Nations if it prioritizes populist views.
"korang hype pasal mat kilau pun pasal ada movie dia je kan ? kalau tak ada sikit pun taknak ambil tahu pasal mat kilau, dasar hipokrit"
"I’m not interested in the Mat Kilau movie, but imagine how he felt when he saw the government of the state spilling its own land and flying the flag at half-mast for three days lol"
So the Mat Kilau movie is just to make fun of other nations? Oh that cam.
Movie Mat Kilau has reached rm90 million in a day. Can continue watching on Netflix.
The fact is that the film is Mat Kilau and has no impact whatsoever
Nobody watched Mat Kilau the movie in Pahang!
"still insane to me mat kilau passed endgame in sales LMAO. not that endgame is a cinematic masterpiece, but mat kilau able to harness melayu keris energy. parents aku pergi tengok dekat wayang kot! last time they went to the movies was back 06 kot, buli balik."
"I’m getting confused....
What is the purpose of screening the movie Mat Kilau that day????"
sorry malay movies never got a place in my heart kecuali mat kilau
I don’t think I have to mention how unexplainable everything is in air force. I have a lot of question and no answer at the end of the movie. Sama mcm mat kilau. And this is not even comparing them to top gun. Serious zero rating for air force.
"Sorry la but after watching air force and mat kilau, Malay writers need to step up or just make drama movies. Redha and pulang are seriously one of the best movies I’ve seen"
air force the movie <3333 wayyyy tooo goodddd deserves more hype just like paskal and mat kilau 100% recommended!!! cried twice at the end of the movie hihi everyone so hot and handsome but adi putra my fav encemmmm angattt <33333
"Just watched Leftenan Adnan on Netflix and my conclusion (again for the hundredth time) is:-

IT IS 10000000x BETTER THAN MAT KILAU AND IT WAS PRODUCED IN THE YEAR 2000!!! 

Leftenan Adnan was and is still the benchmark. Learn from this please @/Directors yang nak buat war movie."
"Totally agree. It’s rubbish when we ask people to watch Malay movies, people reply, eeiii... I’m not used to watching Malay movies... I don’t know what you guys are doing... so much so that I can’t see it because I’ve turned away from Malay."
"Color grading is the best bro. First time looking at the best color grading film, Mat Kilau has the worst"
"That day, in conjunction with independence, he rented a lot of ramps, daggers, clothes in conjunction with being hit by the Mat Kilau of the movie 

Staff mcd kangar also rent on 31 August."
"3. Mat Kilau
I feel sleepy watching this movie but this movie should be shown every Merdeka"
"The patient is a 10-year-old boy who comes to wear a brace, does not want to open the tooth extraction time.

After seeing Mat Kilau ready to stop studying Taekwondo, take up martial arts.

When we want to poke him, he is afraid, we are close to him. Mat Kilau is afraid, then he opens his mouth as wide as possible 

The influence of the movie is really good."
"Why aren’t many people excited about this Anak Rimau movie?
I think Anak Rimau is more interesting than Air Force & Mat Kilau
Look at Anak Rimau, you really have nothing to lose
#AnakRimau @Beto_Kusyairy"
Personally for me Air Force The Movie - Selagi Bernyawa is a better movie than Mat Kilau.
"Best juga Airforce the movie. Satu lonjakan baru saya rasa dalam genre peperangan filem Malaysia. 

Saya yakin selepas Mat Kilau dan Airforce the movie, akan banyak lagi movie-movie peperangan atau berlatarkan sejarah yang boleh bersaing dengan movie Hollywood dari genre yg sama."
People won’t hesitate to spend money on local movie if it’s as good as  and also Mat Kilau. I also like this one a lot better than PASKAL
"Watched Air Force The Movie: Selagi Bernyawa yesterday with my family. It’s AWESOME!

My unpopular opinion: lagi best dari Mat Kilau and Paskal. I like the story line and how suspense a war situation can be. I brought me in the situation like I was actually in the war."
@GSCinemas why is the speaker sound at GSC Kluang so bad especially at hall 1 when it doesn’t Mat Kilau then airforce the movie at hall 3. It’s seriously spoiled...
"Pascal (10/10)
Mat Kilau (9/10)
Air force the movie (8 /10)
BAKARA 
Police Evo 3 

If you want to watch Malaysian movies, you really like action movies, hahaha love love or ghosts, but I don’t know if I really like them"
"It’s not bad that Air Force The Movie is technically better than Mat Kilau, only the CGI is a bit less"
