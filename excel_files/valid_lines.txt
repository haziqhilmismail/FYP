One of the strong parts from the movie Mat Kilau is the $T$ that he never gets bored.

Movie Mat Kilau, if you have vertigo,don't watch it. Keluaq wayang confirmed that the world is upside down. I can even watch part of the $T$ and feel dizzy

I now conclude that some Malaysiansdon't know how to delve into history and literally make fun of everything,what's so funny about MatKilau?It's a good $T$ with tons of heartfelt moments and
historical movie

Thank godI'm not alone, I thought I was the only one who thought Mat Kilau was cringe ah. $T$ were great, I just felt the movie was over romanticized with them

A simple review about Mat Kilaufilm: I just watched it on netflix last night, for the first time,it's a standard local movie, with the most important $T$ sequence style, slow motion must be there, and I have a feeling that this scene looks like a movie scene

1. Cringe $T$ 2. Special Moves mini reunion 3. Naively narrated 4. Although the name of the movie is Mat Kilau, from the movie alone, how much did we get to know MatKilau? Imo,Beto*s character was more dominant 5. The sound effect of the fighting scene is extreme, losing the guitar

That means neutral,you're not Malay, and youdon't know Mat Kilau. $T$ in the story is very low. There is indeed a messy plot, for example Awang, the motive behind the creation of the role of Awang is not clear. Wanted to turn it into a drama in a movie, but itdidn't happen. From the beginning to

Don't compare it with foreign movies, local movies too, sergeant hassan, even paskal. There is the same element of patriotic spirit without the cringe $T$& messy plot. But Mat Kilau is still crazy, just becauseit's Malaysian. Try to turn off the hype& watch it with a neutral feeling. Still
