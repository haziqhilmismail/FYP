Ican't blame the Mat Kilaute film tbh. bcit's relevant to that point of time. Malays were really struggling back then.don't nitpick history for your own
Chat against people who watch Mat Kilau but vote for PH. Mat Kilau is against the colonialists. Ahfool! You know Mat Kilau from the movie, youdidn't study history
Movies like Mat Kilau shown to $T$(below18) should be prohibited, when you are not mentally able to make sound decisions, we could see a bunch of hooligans running around stabbing and chopping

Over and over again, there are movies with Mat Kilau,it's just the characters that are repeated over and over again. Because Idon't even know history myself,right? Just say what is there as long as it looks like it is there
Next time watching the movie once is enough. The3-4 times you look at that Mat Kilau,it's really a shot to your brain, even yourbrother's brother is dizzy, BN is falling, andyou're getting dizzy

I remember there was a movie reviewer who discussed the Malaysian demographics affecting the collection of movies. At that time, people were talking about RM 30 million as the most they could get if you take into account the audience factor on Earth. Hopefully MatKilau's story will attract anon-Earthly audience
just pure arrogance Mat Kilau movie had cemented into the mainstream. Many Malays now feel comfortable showing theirs
I just saw Dahmer andI'm feeling nauseous..it's not yet Eid gain andit's a movie. Idon't see the Mat Kilau

Idon't understand why some Malays are unable to understand Mat Kilau movie deeply. Some of them believed we should againts opposition nowadays but infact we should unite againts the Malay government that we have now This is a clear and accurate description down to the hole
Mat Kilau on Netflix seems like a different experience compared to watching in theater. Watching it in theater the speaker is so loud and loud and loud but in netflix it feels like a normal sound

Why did many people hit the Mat Kilau after it was shown onnetflix? Was it the greatest movie onearth? Definitely no. But I did enjoy it despite the $T$ that was so meh. Maybe the experience at the movie theater and TV is different, but at the movie theater,it's in the right mood.

The problem is correct. Ifit's a hollywood story, release the same scene as in the Mat Kilau. This tribe does not want to condemn.

Why are so many people suddenly arguing over MatKilau? I still think it was a fantastic $T$, Idon't care what other people say. When a movie manages to make you feel strongly emotional about something, for me it is a definite success, despite its probable

Mat Kilau is great for debates even on the storyboard, there are people chatting who say what movie is there sb. Well, sadly, not all of them are in Msia, bro. Haha but a good $T$ always has their own notes on his script. Ifit's like kabir, he makes a ready shot list for every scene in the script

Repeat after me.."MAT KILAU IS NOT A HISTORY MOVIE.
Who is interested in watching Mat Kilau movie,don't force people who are not interested to be interested. Those who are not interested in watching Mat Kilau,don't force interested people not to be interested.That's just a story for me. Designed and created for film. Some like it, somedon't like it.
for me..it's the best thing.. Ididn't see it at the movie, I still feel it.. then twice I saw it on netflix.. for me, its ok.. where is the perfect movie. we as humans are not perfect, this is a movie. $T$ are boring. over ja malaysian netizens

At first, Ididn't see the Mat Kilau at GSC,it's strange why the language is not right, but when you think about the logic of the spa language, you still want to use it for movies, you want to use b. baku,it's illegal for people to understand,right? I want to read the subs, I want to feel the scenes again.. I just got it.. Last, if you want to make a whole movie, use that language
Now youwon't believe how much American Political Agenda was shot in that movie but the $T$ is pretty much shit through and through. The reason for its success is simple, Giant Transforming Robots Fight Each Other. Same goes with Matt

It's a good feeling to watch a Mat Kilau movie with another netflix.That's why a lot of people sayit's not the best when watching netflix Mat Kilau movies

Idon't want to defend and condemn more fictional movies whose characters are just coincidences with history. Fictional. Rekaan. We should not even care if Mat Kilau is wearing a superman shirt riding a dinosaur against the British while singing a song
It's also funny the fanatics whocan't see people commenting on the Mat Kilau movie like this movie determines Malay sovereignty. Technical critics and pushy $T$. Each POV. Do you want a story that lifts silat and the script is okay but the budget is way lower but a goodmovie? My take is

It's fun to curse the movie Mat Kilau.I'm quite happy that someone is willing to make a movie about a historical figure, not an influencer, a drug kingpin who speaks Malay plates, a rich family who wants to pay for it, a slapstick comedy that has no direction

matkilau's story(not themovie) is inspirational andshould've been done right in the movie, bcs i am not feeling the malay propaganda in this
because I already know the story line& the sound at my house is not as good as in the movie. I will never watch a movie that Ididn't understand the first time. I watched it again just once. I thinkit's best because I already know the storyline& I like it because I understand it, butit's upside down, peopledon't
Why are the gangs of gangs who are angry about Mat Kilau beingcriticized? Are you the one who benefits from this movie or do you feel that the dignity of your nation and country is beingchallenged? Criticism This can be used as a step to further improve the level of our film industry. We already know there is potential
This Mat Kilau story can be a type of investigative film. Detective movie. Find out who is the defector of Malay officials. At the end, Mat Kilau seems to have sacrificed himself forPahang's victory, but the final scene shows him living in the forest. The black shirt with the raspy voice is there, allthat's left is the mask...
$T$ for omputeh roles is inexplicably bad. WTF. Sikh soldiers are portrayed asone-dimensional sadists. Mat Kilau is political propaganda wrapped in a morality play— given themovie's cultural impact, a longer essay on this might be

Hahaha every month he subscribes not just to watch one story, not Mat Kilau but the movie on Netflix. Idon't even have netflix free. But when you think about it, people want to wait for Netflix because they want to chill and save money

Have your own opinion.. about this Mat Kilau.. at least there is anger towards the colonialists..that's good enough.. sometimes these tribes are one thing more than foreign movies.. littered with stories about movies.. for me, Malaysians rarely do factual stories.. want to ask to read history, kaji. jauh.. read a novel
Why do many people say MatKilau's story isbad/give a badrating?That's why before this, why can the movieexplode?

I've seen Mat Kilau on netflix already. SyamsulYusuf's typical action movie.I'm so bored that Idon't feel like commenting.
I see the best. Your mind is narrow to make a comparison with Hollywood,it's really different, people with a budget of ten million. Matt kilau is a movie about history, where can you turn it away like an action orsci-fi movie, you expect
Also, the one who made Cite Mat Kilau is Syamsul Yusof, one of the best movie $T$ in Malaysia. If the movie he made is a lot of complaints, let alone another author who produced the story. Anyway,it's ok, at least there is a story that shows about history

Well saidmate!I'm not a fan of $T$, but because the movie Mat Kilau has an exhaustive chapter on the history of Mat Kilau,I'm looking for reading sources. He has that effect, I can feel it baby.That's for me, to get distracted by other movies

Sept 18, 2022- Ihaven't seen Mat Kilau yet, no movies& no Netflix. Anyone who has seen it, understands that it is a movie, not the History Channel. So there is a little adjustment, so chill.. just enjoy it
Haven't watched Mat Kilau. Had a chance to see the Air Force.It's not the kind of diligent to watch movies actually, but people invite us onz. Usually had time to sleep in there But watching AirForce that day, Ididn't even feel sleepy. Luck
Its an adaptation based on what actually happened, of course some modifications were made. The two scenes practically made the whole movie bro. Mat kilau is a real figure and how he was depicted fits his description in history, whether you like it or not
It's as if he opened a Mat Kilau movie just to contrast with the one he saw on the stage before, he just wants to say the Mat Kilau Mat Kilau $T$ is bad, low iq, shaky camera, only for Malay, only 10 minutes

Remember we have moved on from Mat Kilau when the movie release near the cinema. Nowwe're all back to square one

It's not like that.Don't judge people like that. For me, I feel crazy and strange when I read the replies in this thread that are all about Mat Kilau.. Just enjoy it, just watch the movie

Idon't know why you want to defend the Mat Kilau movie so much, the quality is not equal, the standard of SY has that movie, he is good at trying new things& has a strong influence in commercial but the movie does not depict the real atmosphere of Mat Kilau
Yes correct. But please make the story of the prophet and make it a historical fiction movie.That's what Idon't agree with. Ni Kisah mat kilauBeb: Even thoughit's big,it's not the same. But there is also input,right: psl silat psl religion psl war with colonialists. So we take it as good input
Saying Mat Kilau a bad movie not going to make you cool... And I am not cool... Eye candy from the style frame but not in actual footage and it the movie is forcing too much. To be honest, most of the movies by Samsul have a cringy $T$. I felt funny rather than

Hahah, I said this Mat Kilau was inspired by the movie wong feihung because the sound effect is like Chinese martial art
The raid is an Indonesian film.. the director of captain america only admitted that his fighting scene was inspired by the raid.. even samuel l jackson said that the raid was his all time favorite movie.. this is a Mat Kilau finish you set with the raid
Special Moves series PASCAL Police Evo Mat Kilau Everyone has their own class Maybe wedon't know how many children of Watan whose exposure topolice/soldiers/heroes came from this movie For me, this is more important than debating the cinematography issue
Cany'all please STFU about reviewing MatKilau? If you like it, great. If youdon't,it's alright. Everyone has their own taste when watching movies or TV shows. But ify'all make shit up just to fight over a MOVIE, go fuck yourself and touch some grass
Actually, I want to rate the Mat Kilau low because I can yawn throughout the story. It rarely happens. But because people buy movie tickets, so I end up rate is high, sayingit's good but not the best
I hope to be able to see MatKilau's character live, what kind of personality he has. his conversational style. what I understand is only philosophy. The script of the movie and the character of Mat Kilau is not
When Mat Kilau comes out on neflix, movie critics come out and comment like this, Air Forcehasn't yet had a story on neflix, ghisau is turned away by the soldiers who comment later. Guys, to produce a movie requires mental and physical sacrifice from each member
That means neutral,you're not Malay, and youdon't know Mat Kilau. $T$ in the story is very low. There is indeed a messy plot, for example Awang, the motive behind the creation of the role of Awang is not clear. Wanted to turn it into a drama in a movie, but itdidn't happen. From the beginning to

Have you ever seen the IPstory? How is he against 10people? But those who attack him are not all at once. Just like this Mat Kilau story.It's called a story. If you want to be logical, you just read history. No need to look

Mat Kilau is a movie. But netizens who are so sarcasticcan't be criticized. There are critics like it should depict101% of history, whichdoesn't make sense because the movie is made to appeal to the most segment

Already watched Mat Kilau. How tosay? I can only give around 1 out of 5 stars. There are so many weaknesses. If youdon't want to get ready to relax, fill in the space or give it to the kids,that's it. But not recommended at all for actionmovies/dramas& history lovers. I like action genre and history
Malay klu in the chat section condemned person no. 1. Hg tgk movie not documentary. He has already made a disclaimer. He has a movie he likes.It's not based on the true story of the last two blackhawkdowns, the westdidn't win apo. Suh barat has a hero to make a new Mat Kilau comparable to your taste

not surprised to see mat kilau getting low ratings from people.i've said it before that the pacing was so off and the dialogue sounds pretentious in every way. you can make apatriotic/historical movie without it being as messy as it is

true! many discussions in terms of expanding knowledge in history this what historical movies should be, endless discussion. Independence does not happen without discussions. mat kilau is more like promoting culture w history but history is more

Personally, I reallydon't like the movie directed byYusoff's son becauseI've seen it once on TV, Munafik. Hahahaha so when this Mat Kilau comes out,I'm skeptical when people sayit's crazy. The timeline is full of words,it's not the best whenit's on Netflix. Fortunately, Ididn't run out of money
Don't compare it with foreign movies, local movies too, sergeant hassan, even paskal. There is the same element of patriotic spirit without the cringe $T$& messy plot. But Mat Kilau is still crazy, just becauseit's Malaysian. Try to turn off the hype& watch it with a neutral feeling. Still

They are using MatKilau's name for the movie,he's the main character, so I think the least they could do is add in a little bit of history to show thathe's"MatKilau".I'm not talking about100% history, but at least I think there should be a distinctive scene based on

After watching the Mat Kilau movie. The camera is not relaxing. Left right front back. Part opponent to jetty to tgh bersilat to. X relax eh. Time to chat with a lot of people, change the shot every 2 seconds. Eye pain, loss of focus. Suddenly the drone shot, went back in for a close shot
instead of watching Mat Kilau, you should watch Paloh, a good pseudo historical movie by adman salleh. although the editing was quite poor Idon't mind as long as the actors were paid well
Ni citer Mat Kilau or the documentary History of the school syllabus,

Today the movie Mat Kilau is out on Netflix.I'm sorry, am I the only one who thinks this story isoverrated? I like Puteri Gunung Ledang again. At the beginning of the Mat Kilau movies, I started asking, was there an inner hood in the olddays?

the biggest mistake coming from the most visible film was the fact that NO ONE used the Pahang accent throughout the whole movie, especially when it was set at Jerantut like come on
I hope youdon't lose the luster like you do in brsilat. But watching air force the movie feels the sacrifice of our army for the sake of the country. The sense of sacrifice that we hope is our own is not always possible... Cita is a lot of dead characters
Air Force, the movie is really hyped,it's like a Mat Kilau finish. Jlan Cita is the best. X cliché, fighting hard.. fighting hard. The path of ambition is crazy. It feels like the sacrifice of a military hero.. There are only one or two characters that stand out. Wlupn core cita psai Rock ngn
I want to ask a little, the one who is interested in the Mat Kilau movie reference,don't you study History atschool? After watching the movie, will you know about Mat Kilau and the battle againstoppressors? If this is the case, just abolish the History subject and replace it with a subject
Lps mat kilau, many people spread hate towards british for colonizing malaysia and scooping up all theearth's produce. But.. How boujapan? Is it because the movie"embun"doesn't top like a MatKilau? In conclusion wecan't erase history but why bother until you want to play racist
The one who said that is gobloq. Ignore it. A lot of people watch Mat Kilau because this is one of the filmmakers' efforts to build a movie about history after a long time. The effort is pretty good. We also study hero Mat Kilau in school. Therefore, many dtg
