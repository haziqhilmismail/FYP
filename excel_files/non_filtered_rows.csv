"Movie Mat Kilau best . All of us are excited about the anti-colonial side . Ready to fall in love with martial arts . Anwar's movie , no appeal . I'm asking the boys now , did the movie go viral?"

Mat Kilau > Anwar *In terms of the movie
"Anwar & Mat Kilau movie . I've noticed that Malaysians are too much against/glorifying the fact that films like fact/documentaries . Of course there are inaccuracies/fallacies . Do you really believe that Leonardo Dicaprio died on the Titanic?? It's just a movie , bro . Just enjoy it as it is"

Just watched Mat Kilau Why did they treat Mat Kilau's fight scenes as the characters were superheroes . . . The movie itself was OKAY but the glaring issues came from the fight scenes and Captain Syers (his writing was honestly pretty comical it was
Better than all malaysian movies better than Mat Kilau camera Mat Kilau
What record is this uki? This movie looks like dark web
"After the Mat Kilau movie , everybody is a"
"first of all , i never agree with people who condescend the legend Mat Kilau himself , ofc he is one of our national heroes . however , it is never a reason for people to justify shamsul bcs the movie just was terrible and deceptive for so many"

"There is a truth , there is a mistake in this statement . Personal is personal . But there are issues like beating people who don't want to stay in support . Let's see if his movie sells or not . Even though the drama penyondol has started and the movie isn't the best , the Mat Kilau is also sold"

Maybe Mat Sakau the movie will win Oscar since Mat Kilau

"Malaysians don't deserve TSMY , just go and celebrate mat kilau"
Imaginur is a movie about Alzheimer's . Nothing much . Overhyped same as Matt
"Random thought . As much as I don't like Mat Kilau , they kinda dropped the ball by not releasing any OST . People are streaming Hasrat after watching Imaginur and the movie has only 3 million collections . Granted it is a good song and its my new sendu song . I just think its a missed"
hahaha I'm not sure if Malay movies are hard to watch in cinemas . You can count with your fingers haha . . I always wait for Astro to come out . I can't see it on netflix .

Mat Kilau is one of the most regrettable movies I've ever seen
"Congratulations , you discovered how the movie business works? Do you want a PhD? How do you think Mat Kilau did so well at the box office?"
A movie should be a movie . It's not like a school Independence Day time video play . Talking about Mat Kilau and all the movies that are similar
Compare imaginur with Mat Kilau like comparing movie avengers with beautiful
"For every 'Mat Kilau' movie , there is a 'Flying Butter' . . . I say , why"
People want to compare with Habibie & Ainun but they forgot that he was already retired by the time those movies were out . And Indonesians are mostly more big-hearted when it comes to films . Malaysians are conflicted about Mat
no cus Mat Kilau movie was

"Just watched Mat Kilau and Airforce The Movie . The movie that was hype before this . Yes , I'd rather watch a movie/drama late than follow the hype . For me who studies martial arts and is a palapes tudm officer and also a fan of the action genre , I enjoy every single moment of the"
"This Imaginur movie should have received a warmer reception than Mat Kilau . But that's it , this kind of movie choice won't be very well received . Mat salleh is the same , the power movie that won the oscar , where do people see it? If you appreciate art , I really recommend Imaginur . "
"I like the Mechamato series too and don't like the Mat Kilau movie . Trust my review , indeed"
"ok change if the movie is Mat Kilau , if it's a taylor swift song , if it's a book , I'll make upin ipin srs srs I'll arrive just opet pasipaka sipakapaka"

"Weiii hahaha I like to watch Mat Kilau movies but I don't even agree with your shadow cabinet , don't do that . I still support this unity government . Tired of self-centered politics"
"It seems that many Malays would like it if there were no Chinese/Indians in the government . If you don't believe it , you can go into the village or ask people who like to watch Mat Kilau movies . Most of them like that the government is 100% Malay , but they don't want to admit to being racist . It is said to dignify the nation . "
better than Mat Kilau propaganda
"Watching mat kilau for the very first time on netflix . Man . . it is shitty , but in a sense it is entertaining . Like we watch Malay dramas at 7 o'clock . We enjoy bashing on the absurdity . In a sense its like watching a b movie for the heckin fun of it . Shit movie anyways"

"Btw , I rarely like Malay movies (except for the scenario of zombies , bananas , razors , lipstick goals , cun , surrender , eh , I like it lol) ok , I don't like it . But I saw thick bikerz 2 and I got hooked until the end . His fighting scene doesn't hurt"

"Is there no other argument? It's clear that the movie is only shown on netflix , not in the cinema . Try hard , it's really annoying . Call your Mat Kilau and tell me"

It's good to watch Doraemon from the point of view of this movie . That day TER saw the Mat Kilau . Regret for life . I won't watch any of his movies anymore
It's like a white person said people of Malay descent won't have equal rights in their country but applauding Mat Kilau movie . Can you imagine?

"Different people have different tastes . If you think the Mat Kilau is 1/5 , you don't want to force people to accept it , you have an opinion . Because if that person likes the movie , it must have a high rating . Try to celebrate other people's opinions"

"If Mat Kilau was a good movie and money well spent then , why would the behavior of its director now make some change"
I can never understand people who liked Mat Kilau (the movie) . . . like . . . it's
The Mat Kilau movie is more action
"My whole family didn't see the Mat Kilau at the cinema when the movie came out . Good luck ~ netflix came out , my family didn't watch less than half because I was bored , I almost fell asleep . Don't know about that"
Today's movie sol has exceeded 97 million views and has caused the ranking of mat kilau to fall
"insane and hilarious how the director of munafik and mat kilau , both very islamic centered movies , is a munafik"
Luckily I saw Mat
"I'm so thankful I didn't watch the Mat Kilau movie , I don't support you"
Mechamato please beat Mat Kilau's
"Clearly the situation here , he did not make an initial statement , as his new movie has just been launched , it lacks luster . Lps launch is proud of millions of collections . When the situation calms down , the luster of the vibe is gone , he dares to show up to make a statement for his wife"
I'm glad I don't watch that Mat Kilau
I don't really care about his gender . Those who don't know how to understand the crazy Mat Kilau movie can't get a collection of 80 million . Air Force The Movie is 10x better than Mat
"To syamsul yusoff , i would like to say your mat kilau movie is suck and same as you . And to kaza's family your whole family is"
"This movie is also the best , from moto mat to gangster mat to hypocrite mat to superstition mat to Mat Kilau , finally matrimonial mat"
"I'm proud that I didn't watch the movie Mat Kilau . It doesn't Mat Kilaur that it's about his work , it has nothing to do with his personal life . her money will never go to her mistress , because her work will spend her husband's money"
"but when it is confirmed that syamsul is polygamous , this is the time for Sarah's daughter to file and scrape away all the marital property , support all . the latest movie he died Mat Kilau millions of income , right? rich auto baby! If I don't want to spend the night , I don't care! take the rest of my trash . "

"as far as upin ipin is concerned for huge influence , it's different if your movies , dramas or songs etc can be hyped directly here , that's the big influence . This Mat Kilau is really hyped there and here , no one sees it . not to mention other movies . where"
"""just there"" doesn't mean a lot bro :) the upin ipin , the boboiboy is okay to accept , but the others I doubt It doesn't balance if you try to compare with influences from soap operas , movies , songs etc from Indo The lack of hype in Msia doesn't work here , not to mention other movies"
"yea they should instead have a summary where u vouch for uh , top gun remake as a good movie over mat kilau and call prc human beings bio bombs in a climate of mounting sinophobia"
I think Didi And Friends the movie will beat this Mat Kilau . Hahaha hooray

"first time tgk Mat Kilau . 3 minutes in and I'm already heartbroken . Yes it's a fictional movie , but using Indonesians as British subordinates is so fucking funny"
It's no wonder that some people say that comeback concerts that last 30 minutes are the best . Some people are ready to say that Mat Kilau is the best Malaysian Movie . 
also just remembered this was the very last movie i've watched in the cinema before mat kilau
"I don't really like watching mat kilau movies , it's like listening to lectures . . . but hey . . people want to make any movie as long as they have an audience and they are making profit . . there are many other mat salleh movies that don't know what to do and don't get in even the mind is still stubborn , he is a person"
Cte air force the movie as long as it's alive is wayy better than the overhyped Mat Kilau
Gotta list all of my favorite movies of 2022 so far: 1) MechaMato Movie 2) Minions: The Rise of Gru 3) Beavis and Butthead Do The Universe 4) Mat Kilau 5) Turning
This recorder
he's been a flop the mat kilau movie was not even a good one
Literally why me and my mom boycott all of his movies including Munafik and Mat Kilau
"Later , when you go to netflix , the first thing you turn away is the comment , it's normal , this movie is blah blah blah , it's like a Mat Kilau movie"
I can't elaborate a lot of movie mat
"When the Mat Kilau is a little opposite , there is no movie from outside . So easy to win too . Can't have fun not wanting an opponent from"
Because this mechamato movie doesn't get vibes like Mat Kilau . come on support local animation
"Is there anyone who wants to do a review of the mechamato movie . . you're peeling it like an onion . Come on , come on"
I never want to agree with the rating of the movie review mom . The Mat Kilau is rubbish . A movie that is not worth it for you to watch many times . Somehow he's still hot with people he doesn't agree with
It's normal to be influenced by Mat Kilau film . that's what he's proud of
Mat Kilau is not an IQ movie
Invite me to see Mechamato but bring up the Mat Kilau movie situation . And here comes the tweets of fans and haters condemning each taste and swearing
"Month 8?? Oh my God , isn't it the mass of us in the era of the Malay party that turned away from Islam , the best movie until the people of Kelantan watched it in Terengganu? If that's the time to end the wushu player's service , that's okay"
"But that's his review , so I like what he wants to say about the movie . As I looked at the Mat Kilau , I didn't really agree with the zhaf , but at the end of the day it's everyone's opinion , so accept it , he wants to say 5 stars mat Mat Kilau"
"what's the fuss about this movie , just accept it , it's the middle of the movie , isn't it?"
"How many times has this store installed the Mat Kilau movie , other customers have told me to turn it off and not watch it"
"When you have mentioned 2 movies , why is one movie about noisy people and one movie about people who are not noisy . That's a comparison . It has to be realistic before comparing the elements in the movie . Mat Kilau is a historical fiction movie and Mechamato is a movie"
"If you want to fight the Mat Kilau , you have to bring a school group haha . Mat kilau got a lot of quotes because many groups came . Hope the agent of ali movie 2 can be more than rm50"
"the movie is the MUST WATCH movie in 2022 . Seriously , I'm not kidding . Even adults laugh in movies . Can Mat Kilau lose please guys?"
"Mano who turned away from the ""support local"" fighters at that time , if you don't watch this mechamato movie , I'll pull your hair out"
"I just hope that their decision to vote PN is not based on Mat Kilau movie Race and religion are two easy ways to use to influence people especially the young . Could also be that these voters are people who reject corruptors in BN , ""communists"" in DAP . PN = last"
"7 . The fighting scene in this movie highlights the art of martial arts . I like & admire the way the publisher works the elements of martial arts in a modern and epic framework . If the film Mat Kilau showcases traditional martial arts , then this film is the Mat Kilau version"
"The promise of serving the devil , all the movies are dull . . But yaya , I also wear specs . . I'm afraid that my eyes will be different . . I'm afraid to shareee"
"Mat kilau is played , chin peng is supported , si"
"Thought it's gonna be Mat Kilau vs . Airforce The Movie head to head tonight , but Small Town Heroes and Spilt Gravy are the real ones"
This cabinet minister is worse than
"Yeah , maybe it's Van Gogh's that you say suck . Just like the movie Mat Kilau korg said the best . Which is . . . taste korg . Junk or Diamonds . Your happiness is money"
This movie should be the last source of reference . We will not get the image of Mat Kilau if we see the movie
"Same , I also blaspheme this movie . Even in the 2000s , movies are still bad Is your movie good? I've never watched me , I've watched it like a soap opera"
Is this some kinda dialogue from mat kilau movie . . . . . . same old rethoric been recycling
Goodnight Tweepies! . . . I'm tired and going to watch a movie called MAT KILAU . . 2022 . . on Netflix . have a good night and see you
"If you're Malay , just go see it , all Malaysians will watch this movie later"
any film should beat mat kilau lah . . . most overrated movie ever . and i'm a superconservative
Look at the Mat Kilau movie
"Many people diss the movie Mat Kilau . I don't think it's necessary , unless you want to criticize the film . Let's celebrate our local film"
IF THAT ANWAR MOVIE COMES OUT PLEASE MAKE IT BEAT MAT KILAU IN
"Don't provoke , but people who have turned away from religion and the PN race will never stop questioning the election of the Malay Muslim King and Agong , his supporters are still a little bit post quote movie mat kilau . Do you want to say that the Agong is selling the religion and race to Malay land himself?"
This movie I will go watch!! Mat Kilau can now be saved in the archive . Not relevant
"He is fighting for Malay supremacy and the position of Islam (this is what PN supporters say) . Anwar supports LGBT and interferes with Malay rights (according to them) . Follow the spirit of Mat Kilau from the movie (reference to PN members) , FIGHT UNTIL THE MOMENT"
Source
Forgive me too @zhafblock . Unblock me . I promise not to curse your movie taste . But it's really Mat Kilau
Londeh don't not londeh . It's fun to see Malays arguing with each other . Like watching the movie Mat Kilau vs Hang Tuah . Other nations just applaud . Londeh while eating lodeh with rice
"<--- just got in the mood to get angry at the paid tiktok boy who allegedly ""watched the movie many times but voted ph"" . That movie"
People who were overhyped over Mat Kilau (movie) are just as stupid as the Brits (& rest of the world) who believe The Crown was treated as
when mat kilau first came out: BEST . MAKE MORE LOCAL MOVIES LIKE THIS . MALAY SPIRIT . GET IT TO 100M after mat kilau came out on netflix: this movie is not even the best . do not follow
"Tbh , I have never seen the full Mat Kilau movie . Only a quarter of the movie , so I don't know what made Brade tiktok show the sword inside"
Yusuf Azmi is one of the most wretched and bastard human beings . mat kilau is a shitty propaganda movie . Hadi Awang should be thrown into
"This PN boy can send a Mat Kilaute vd to your brother who went viral on tiktok saying that he is Malay and has never been united , why do you want to link to another movie"
"Mat Kilau is the one to blame . If it's true that the movie is probs , supposedly the issue has arisen for a long time right after it was shown . Even after it was shown at the cinema , it received millions of collections , and it's already on netflix . Not related"
To make a good movie is not actually by stating all facts but to put a little bit of fiction . It is called entertainment miss . If it is a documentary yes it will be all fact . There are a lot of lessons learned in the movie mat kilau . Take it positive and learn from
"Just watched the movie Mat Kilau once , I'm already a warrior of the country , defender of religion . If I show a picture of the actual Mat Kilau and how he is , other people will believe it . "
"That movie , Mat Kilau , stirred some real problems . Factually so wrong yet so dangerous . It should be banned and its producers fined for such blatant disregard for"
"Real Deadly Violence is not like the movies , kids . It's not Mat Kilau , Bond or Superheroes . Don't play with the idea . "
"I am not suggesting any party to be corrupted . I'm saying that sometimes it is wise to keep quiet when we are uncertain . Not to mislead , create slander , and create this separation between us just like the sayings of your so loved Mat Kilau"
Finas is also one . Can you approve racist content like the Mat Kilau movie? Do you want to practice? The KKN kissing scene in the Dancer Village is said to be unethical . Apo . Your mouth doesn't burn if we say fire . 
"The fact that these boys are spreading video snippets from the movie Mat Kilau isn't it a racial issue? when people are educated about the movement with MCA , they suddenly spin and say it's not a racial issue . some of you guys are just racists and enablers and it"
It's not over to the Mat Kilau film issue
three widows did more for the malay movie industry than
"this is not talking about the real Mat Kilau btw , he was a real hero . the movie is still"
the movie itself
"Haven't seen the movie mat kilau , which I suspect is a propaganda film sponsored by people with hidden agendas . Our youths r not politically aware maybe? If yes , it would be a narrow shallow pov . They're looking for"
"I hate those ppl r like ""mat kilau x best"" ""camera goyang ii"" if ur that professional , why don't you just record the movie? Also if u dont like the movie u dont hav to tell ppl laa . . . thats ur opinion why are you busy telling others"
"The Mat Kilaute movie is not wrong , but those kids who are over it are more"
"The movie doesn't Mat Kilau , but it's the boy's tiktok that over likes"
"still ppl are not focusing on how racist that movie is , pn supporters are using mat kilau the movie as an excuse to vote for abah literally most of the ppl who mentioned about mat kilau are rempits high"
Is it me or does it seem like a lot of the pro-PN racist Malays keep quoting the Mat Kilau movie as an example of why they should reject
"At this point , I think Malaysia's 10th Prime Minister is gonna be Mat Kilau The"
"You know what . I'm tired . . You complain about Malay movies x variety . . when there are historical movies like Tanda Putera Mat Kilau , you are busy trying to ban them . . If this is the case , the country's film industry wants to grow . I'm tired of seeing silly jokes about marriage"
The only good thing to come out of that Mat Kilau movie was that Ricky Gervais fried turmeric
"Ok , when is the anwar ibrahim movie coming out? If the movie is ready in time for him to become PM , it must be a blockbuster . Maybe can fight mat"
Can you tell me the facts of the movie?
"Next time , don't make a movie with a Mat Kilau if the only result is malays being"
My father was also angry about the Mat Kilau film . p/s: he has seen that movie . so he can criticize everything
"Luckily this is the only Malaysian movie that came out . If you have 10 movies , how can you not be a tiktok boy?"
"Well , that's all I want to do with this Mat Kilau movie . There is no country"
Repeat after me: Mat Kilau is NOT a historical movie that should be shown to young children who is not exposed or made understood of the unity of multicultural community in Malaysia prior to
"If you guys don't come out with that Mat Kilau movie , you've never even heard of Mat Kilau Mat Kilau . Why do you have to look at your brother's face for what? Kemon"
I would also like to point out and reiterate AGAIN on how the MAT KILAU movie is a massive influence in giving a voice and inspire extremism and provoke racial sentiments in our
mat kilau was a god damn dangerous movie to release
"Mat Kilau is a real character , the events at Sungai Pahang happened . you want to question the dialogues , some added characters in the movie go ahead but the core of it is true . yes , our forefathers did fight colonialists for the sake of race and religion . ask your grandparents"
"I have a Mat Kilau movie bid , please . The first 10 minutes are off again . "
Mat Kilau you mean the sh movie not based on fact more
Don't say look at the Mat Kilau movie
"when people say that Mat Kilau film brings a bad message , you don't believe it , just watch it"
"My take is Mat Kilau is a fiction . I don't care . They can put Mat Kilau on a unicorn wearing a Superman shirt in the background of a BTS song against the Nazis , for all I care . Its a shit movie"
He
Watch the Mat Kilau movie . When arguing with slang
"HAHAHAHAH damn , I'm more than willing to go ahead and send a pm instead of looking back . Ban the wayang , at least the movie doesn't come out like that"
"* supporters bringing up the mat kilau movie as a point in argument over why PH shouldn't win as though that whole movie wasn't about micro aggression & subtle racism + stereotyping towards other races in this country , "
the isley malay people pls follow madinah's charter not that Mat Kilau movie pls look at social justice rasulullah did like that
"It's time for a movie to come out , there's a lot of people like that , "
ngl but this generation has some weird obsession with that Mat Kilau movie and they just want to follow the trend . Not the movie's fault . But the boy is really as long as he has something to do
"Should have seen it coming when we saw reactions to that Mat Kilau movie , "
"For a fact , I watched mat kilau and it's a very good movie! Definitely not to be applied"
That's why I dislike Mat Kilau movie and
"Try it , if Syamsul Yusuf didn't make that movie , you wouldn't even know him . Try to make PH people amazed skit with information that many people don't even know to incite . It's a non-kindergarten thing , butoh . I'm old enough , the savage can be compared to the movie . "
That stupid Mat Kilau movie didn't help either . . it's basically our version of The Birth of a Nation urgh only instead of KKK we have racist
All
"It's funny to see that this boy is the most Mat Kilau , even the Mat Kilau movie makes my neck swell , not to mention this boy"
"To be honest , I rather watch Rise: Ini Kali Lah"
"Fuck movie Mat Kilau , it should be during the general election that day to filter who says MK movie is the best , send it away"
"When we said Mat Kilau was a bad movie because it's factually incorrect , many Malays were offended . But now , look , many young boys near Tiktok are influenced and make that movie as an inspiration of whomst to vote? And to re-ignite May 13th? What are we teaching our"
And for all young blood who are so affected by Mat kilau do your search better kids . Do not use a 2 hour movie that contains more fiction than fact as yours
I've said boy boy tiktok and mat kilau the movie
Load of crap show thru Tanda Putera n Mat Kilau movie . This is the
"This is the blood of the heroes , watch the movie , this Mat Kilau , defend the leadership of the ulama , hmmm , the attitude reflects who we are , don't blame DAP , it's already behaved like a monkey . "
"Mat Kilau this Mat Kilau that , bffr that movie is fiction . Why can't we be kind to each other without creating any racial or religious fight? I'm so worried like I don't understand why people want to fight and use unnecessary violence . Please we are all the"
After watching the movie mat kilau continue to look at the true malay fighters of those tiktok boys . 
not yet the case of Malay people we are busy updating
It has not been the case that our Malays are so busy updating about the Mat Kilau movie
M
"I didn't watch the movie mat kilau trailer , I didn't watch it at all , so I don't know what it is about the movie mat kilau . I know about Mat Kilau when I was studying at school"
"Seriously , people are surprised that Malaysia has many fascists . Mat Kilau is openly artless , ahistorical fascist propaganda , and it is the highest grossing Malaysian movie by a large margin . I'm surprised"
"Who once said that Mat Kilau film is just a movie , look at the impact now and how it is used"
That's why I said before that Mat Kilau movies are just entertainment . What the hell is the use of matt film for this vote?
"Who has seen Mat Kilau that many times? Look at it once , you're sick of looking at it again . Focus on other movies . Go to National Geographic , can you know that the world is wide , it's not just Malays who sit in the world"
t
"""watch it Mat Kilau many times"" joke on you I despise the movie with my whole heart bc the lack of proper planning , know to attack and want to fight but it seems that's how Malay"
What's so incriminating in Mat Kilau movie pls can someone let me know? I couldn't stop watching for 15 minutes
"guys , I'm sorry , sis , I don't understand because I haven't seen it yet"
"But there is a movie reviewer who supports Mat Kilau and then gets angry when people dispute his judgment , he has another backup ready"
"yes , pn supporters at ws , the status of all the quotes doesn't run out , it's the movie historically"
There is government intervention here . How bad it is . Mat Kilau and those movies alike please get banned . X brings benefits brings disadvantages
"Regardless , it's true that the Mat Kilau movie causes more harm . Many videos mention Mat Kilau . If those kind of movie is not banned and something is not done to promote fascist , it is dangerous . He won't be now but the impact will be seen many years down the line"
"Now . . . . Movie ""MAT KILAU"" WAS ONE OF"
"I'm done with the Mat Kilau , it looks like you know that because it's in the movie , right? It's not wrong , that's not what you can say . there are many more Malay figures who fought for the Malay nation . "
who can believe that this Mat Kilau movie is 100% correct
Faham that this has always been an underlying problem among Malays but i still choose to be a mat kilau movie
I will always
So this tiktok boy is apparently influenced by the movie Mat Kilau?
mat kilau not to the british opponent? I watched the wrong movie
There is also a negative side to this movie mat
"Kann . It really isn't just a movie . Yeee crazy gullible . I just looked at the Mat Kilau , suddenly I'm only Malay . Their eyes . Brain"
The movie mat kilau bangang is a reference . Unlucky
Didn't noe that patrotic movie like Mat Kilau diorang took it
M
"It's normal that the Malays are weak like that , the Chinese are all doing nothing , they're swaying . . . even lost their luster . . . people watch historical movies to learn lessons , improve and improve , not slander the nation"
and the
Movie Mat Kilau
"Yesza depa forget this is the age of the internet . The age of socmed is not the age of newspapers . Things are very easy to spread and people believe . It's true that there are good people , but it's a big mistake to show hatred towards this Malay landlord . The movie Mat Kilau is still hot . Earned"
Haha . I'm sorry I didn't see the Mat Kilau many times because I can't understand from the book
"When I saw the movie Mat Kilau , I wanted to be a hero just like the people in the 2Pac song wanted to be gangsters . "
It's a waste of time for UMNO to make a movie
PN played racial cards more lmao . Mat Kilau's fight apparently that no one knows until the movie came out . Then the fear they instilled on Chinese . And then what attacking Christians in a talk? Could Muuhi be anymore
Same energy like kelantan PAS endorsing Mat Kilau movie (which is an islamofascist propaganda by isma) and tells them to go watch it as much as you can! But there is no fckig cinema in Kelantan at all! Oh the hypocrisy Only endorse entertainment that advances their agendas
There are a lot of tiktok videos
Do you think that China is a colonialist who is arguing about Mat Kilau movies? I don't understand what it has to do with our issue now
fuck this country . can't make films like we want . we are gonna resort to making films like mat kilau and other military propaganda
i
Crying over Mat kilau and visiting the Hang Tuah museum but then forget to practice the pure values in that movie . Islam teaches us to respect human right to respect the others . Respect another religions first before they respect yours . Same goes with the racism
if i see another
"Since PAS has majority seats I highly doubt that they'll just be any minister . Obviously this Hadi wants to be . Imagine . . . No more night clubs , no more concerts , no more Hollywood movies since everything has lgbt la atheism la this la that la . The watch is Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau"
They are not mature enough to think . It's just that they know how hard it is to fight movies . I don't want to be Malay
"I saw ""Mat Kilau"" movie as a horse in Chess game in this political movement . It is indeed a rally of some Malays . How much the spirit of ""Malaysianism and Islam"" is prioritized . And only show that other than Malays are enemies . Which it"
"then it doesn't run out until the Mat Kilau movie is finished . It's not the best , there's nothing to do with it"
"Gsc , tgv all here close now Just look at the Mat Kilau every 2 months In Kelantan , it's like that . When there's an event , just watch the movie and you have to die"
"Be honest ""Mat Kilau"" movie success was a mistake that PH failed to recognize . Being haunted by life like Hang Tuah , When we who refuse are labeled"
People quoting that English man from Mat Kilau movie for whatever is happening right now makes me
"""Mat Kilau"" movie Like a large Boulder swing"
A special thanks to Mat Kilau as well . That movie did wonders to
"Don't say you just enjoy looking at the Mat Kilau but don't take any notice . Such a waste of time and money . When the time comes , you can put into practice what was said in the Mat Kilau film , but it is not put into practice . Why?"
I can already imagine more movies like mael totey mat kilau will fill
"What is your reference from the movie Mat Kilau? Wow , that's a movie . Tang Malay is watching the movie Mat Kilau . Why don't you take the movie reference Rempit to Abang Long Fadil to Bini-biniku Gangster? It's tired"
People didn't believe me when I said Mat Kilau is an anti national movie advocating Malay supremacy sentiments for the election . We've never been more divided as a
not them using Mat
Mat Kilau movie had a huge impact . It sustained a longer period in the cinemas for this to happen . As simple as that
this is all about movie mat
Every single person who thought Mat Kilau was a
"Idk if you guys realize this or not , but this GE15 has opened my eyes about the state that are majority non-Malays are voting for PH . while the Malays are having split votes . It reminds me of Mat Kilau movie , those lines about how Malay will be weakened if we are not"
Many of the Malays stay true to religion and race sentiment . Thats why Mat Kilau movie became box office although it is a meh
so you campaign using movie verses
"Maybe you can watch this malay movie name ""mat kilau"""
"In Malaysia where Kelantanese are okay drinking mud for years , the corrupt don't stand trial , Mat Kilau is a top movie , and we are surprised that Nurul Izzah is doing"
Why is his sentence the same as a Mat Kilau film?
"Tula jihoon , I've never met him until he wants to make Malaysia liberal . Tired of making Mat Kilau movies , the Malay nation is easy to forget"
"Don't be weird , Anthony Loke is going to go to see the movie Mat Kilau just to bullshit the Malays . dr daniel"
"Don't bash me for not looking at the Mat Kilau . I don't even watch TV . What drama , what movie , what netflix"
"Btw , freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of consequences . PH fights for the right to speak (FoS) , but that does not mean that the voice cannot be reprimanded / taken action (FoC) . Speech = Mat Kilau is the best movie ever Consequence = Condemned for no reason"
i just watched mat kilau bro the movie is
I think Airforce movie is better than Mat Kilau . This Airforce can be served two or three times . Mat Kilau is enough to look at once
"Not yetzzzz . Will be . Mat Kilau , until now I can't finish it . There are too many feedback people . So I have already seen the movie"
"What do you want to do , even the name is lustrous , you watch a lot of movies , "
"That's my opinion . Movie Mat Kilau is very cringe . But based on movies that Indonesia has released , there are indeed many masterpieces . So , can expect"
How to block Mat Kilau on Netflix? But I'm gonna tell her netflix delete the movie
"As much as I dislike to watch mat kilau's movie , my 4y/o daughter watched it more than 100 times I think and she knew the sequence what is going to happen next . One hilarious sentence she said it out loud was ""stupid Malays"" . Hey , your son is Javanese Malay tok tok k . "
Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . Can last less than 15 minutes and then close . You are tired of watching this movie
Cringe
All Biggie movie will face the issue go thru the banned finas all because of MAT KILAU they wanna cover up fake Box Office Report cheap mentality grow up
Collab with Mydin & major brands/media outlets . Must include this value in future advertising . Make a movie for hype like Mat Kilau glitter to push the agenda of pampering
"zaman mat kilau has entered the movies , now where are there any more plays , the people of Gombak need hardworking people to represent them , who can work for their benefits not just political"
oh btw i do think some movies are bad but usually i dont know how to put out a review tbh cause i wont even finish a movie once i think its boring other than the fact i rarely go to the cinema so yeah (i watched mat kilau on
"Suspected the Mat Kilau movie was propaganda material . Didn't watch it . Who paid the RM100 million for it? Similarly , the report on TT is election material . Likewise , the pre-recorded message from the thief being aired on national TV . How much taxpayer's money"
It's insanely solid even though it cringes a little like Mat Klaau . But the only movie that The Rock doesn't have
Steady doc . There are many references in the movie
Movies: Mat Kilau Medieval Fall Mother's love Accident man Hitmans
Watch the movie mat kilau ready to climb but become the Mossad's talibarut
My husband really likes Mat Kilau film . He just wanted
"Do you want to study Malay people using Mat Kilau film? One movie is enough to lethargy . It's good that he cites Malays , many people who love him don't develop a mind , it's a little difficult for the Mossad to study Malay people . We prefer to be"
"That's enough 3 . I just want to add that if you make the movie , please detail the narration a little . I didn't see that the first white person came to look for people , before that people served food . It should stand out as a piece of local Pahang cake . That's right . That's right there"
Mat kilau has so many good lines man cant believr im so
Hahaha I'm afraid I want condoms
GOOD LUCK THE FIGHT FOR ILLAM IS NOT A FIGHT FOR THE Mat Kilau UNDERSTANDING JUST A MOVIE THAT IS PAID TO WATCH ON TONTO
"I heard ""who made the Mat Kilau movie? Call the police , call hr . It's"
Bilibili doesn't have it either . . but wtf does it have a movie Mat Kilau?
Movie Day is shown in a Mat Kilau finish . not
"My father wanted to say that he liked the movie Mat Kilau , so I was speechless"
I mean okay if the movie is for good purpose . But another Mat Kilau like films?
Funny thing about your name is that it's similar to my maiden name . Also I heard they said they're going to make a movie that's like Mat Kilau bcs it's . . . 
Fucking
"If you want to find strength , seek Allah - Mat Kilau - This is the second time my eyes shed tears when I heard these words come from that movie . Idk why but these words really pierced my heart As a sinner , I think these words hit me so"
"That's right . Criticism is fine , don't mock the person who eats . It's just like the case of Mat Kilau film that day , it's okay to say that the movie isn't the best , but to say that the person who watched the movie has no taste , he's done"
"Then I sat in the living room watching TV . . at 11:30 am , my sister and I stayed in the living room because the others were already asleep . . so we decided to watch it until it was 12 o'clock . . okay our time Wait , the TV has turned off because I'm watching a movie on my phone"
"today? You bet! Let's go get a tix . And yes , not in a million years will I pay for a Mat Kilau type of local movie . That's pure Malay supremacy propaganda , and really the movie was just bad"
"Stop playing mat kilau all the time bro toldya to open high&low movie , shi literally fire and better writing no"
Speaking of Mat Kilau . I am not an expert in this line . But this movie is overrated . Enough
"-Lack of character growth , or some may call ""The Hero's Journey"" . Mat Kilau and chums were pretty much OP from the start and bent on fighting the British , even getting anointed by the Malay chieftains , and so the movie just shows their exploits upon this motivation until the"
"Mat Kilau is a good movie . For the first time in a long time , a movie where Muslims are the"
"Husband: I don't understand why people say Mat Kilau is boring . Me: not for me , all Malay movies are boring for me . I beat evenly , don't"
Tbh if Malaysian made historical movies they will be top tier like Mat Kilau . Imagine the entire seat filled with Malaysians in their traditional clothes when watching this
"It's actually a nice movie , you should try it"
"I'm sorry I missed the bus , but what's the fuss about the Mat Kilau?"
for the year 2022 - not in the dancer's village - I thought you were home - morbius - bullet trains - matt Mat Kilau - the air force
"In the last week I've watched Morbius (Dull) , The Fullmetal Alchemist Movies (Don't Ask) , Mat Kilau (Malaysian Film) , and my recommendation is Blues Brothers . Was a"
"And all you mentioned are low budget soap operas from the 90s-2000s , if they are in 2022 , it's obviously bad because this year is better than the 90s , well , MAT KILAU appears in 2022 which already has a better movie editing and storyline but he is . . . . . "
Finally got to watch Mat Kilau on Netflix the other day coz didn't get to . The movie was awesome no lie . But sad to see what the future generations have become into . All what they have fought for has
I don't even know what the new series or movie is because I work in the morning for a month . All I know is Mat Kilau . Last week I saw in the MRT using 1 . 25x speed I felt like throwing up hahaha . I want to watch a movie tonight . Last evening I bought marukku so lets

Can you not defend Mat's movie?
Mat Kilau is the worst
"man it's dangerous to say i don't like things anymore not liking Mat Kilau the movie are prone to get attacked it's a fiction , a movie and this is social media we get to say what we like about the movie or not why are we being sensitive"
"I've already talked about 6 people shooting 1 , bro , even Fast and Furious can jump buildings using a car . If you want to make a movie , there's a point . If you want to use logic , don't look at the Mat Kilau , look at National Geographic , that's all there , bro . "
"The local movie , Mat Kilau just went from 'best' in the cinemas to 'teruk' on Netflix . Different categories of audiences with different expectations? Or the movie is average? Haven't watched it yet - will wait for it on"
"Ok done , watch a little Mat Kilau movie near the pc monitor . During the fighting scene . Dizziness . People's cameras don't have a stabilizer on their phones so they shake"
"people are rowdy not because of that luster , but"
"Calling Mat Kilau a propaganda movie is giving a bit too much credit . Good propaganda movies rely on less lazy writing , if nothing else . Its makers were so lazy they had turbaned Sikh soldiers speaking in Hindi . Like , what?! Even in fiction , this bit is just"
"Aah bro , I pay for netflix and the fastest wifi 120 is really just for Mat Kilau . Hundreds of other movies on netflix don't get a single cent . I don't even use my wifi for other things . . I just go back to the cave bro , that's it"
"Mat Kilau the movie had the big disclaimer that it was a work of fiction at the beginning (on Netflix anyway) , while the ""memorial note"" ensures the viewer is aware this is a historical figure . Conflating nationalism , fact , and fiction is the real movie , starring us , "
"Okay , that's enough . Muting the word Mat Kilau because you fucks are annoying as fuck . Movie is shit , deal with it . There is no heavenly reward for that"
"I don't hate the Mat Kilau movie , I just think"
Seeing everyone's Mat Kilau reviews and realizing I couldn't make it past the first 5 minutes . These people who lasted the entire movie are people of great resilience and powerful ability to hate-watch something with such
The stupidest rant award on twitter goes to

Not everyone is interested in Avengers . And not everyone is interested in Mat Kilau . Do you understand? There are many other movies you can watch"

"Everyone talked about Mat Kilau , but if someone wants to make a movie , I live and fight to see Henry Golding so"
The luster of a die-hard movie
Mat Kilau is a flop in my books . I dosed off . PAS-centric . Silat is a beautiful art but unnecessary camera movements my eyes ached . camera movement was the best . Weak storyline . is still the best in terms of periodic-ish local movies like
I will not pay monthly just to see Mat Kilau . Must want to watch the drama
Doesn't Mat Kilaur . It still beat mat kilau in the box office . Not sure why you are going with % of watchers when your main claim is that no Punjabi movie beat mat kilau in box office . I gave you evidence and you did the favor to embarrass yourself . Really failed to reply
There's no end to the chatter about the Mat Kilau movie
"There is nothing free . . Even the monthly is still paid . . . . I pay rm 55 to subscribe to netflix . . Like I pay rm 55 for every 1 movie on netflix . . . If I don't see that Mat Kilau once , I pay rm 55 to see Mat Kilau . . If I see 10 times , I will pay rm 5 . 5 . . Phm"
"Haha , with a huge Indian population still cannot beat Mat Kilau . Nobody watches"
Many have negative comments about the movie Mat Kilau . The difference between watching
In vain Mat Kilau fought to defend religion & homeland only for the modern generation to lower the flag at half-mast to respect the former colonialists . That's the correct sentence . People want to chat about movies
"Real idiot Sikhs . 30% inflation? Haha . Your grandfather from the movie Mat Kilau taught you ah pundek? Hindi movie u claim to b Punjabi , indeed all Sikhs"
"Mat Kilau is 8/10 for me but I wish they could have removed 90% of the preaching in the movie . You can say sincere because of Allah but don't say things in the line of ""destroy oppressors , protect Malay land for Allah"" etc . I don't see Allah plays deus ex machina in your"
"What's the fuss for days about the Mat Kilau movie? That's it , Malaysians"
this mat kilau discourse is so lame like u can like a movie and still admit that it's
Watched Mat Kilau for like 10 mins then went to sleep . I was like this movie to talk
I think Mat Kilau will throw up watching the movie
"people don't make a lot of noise about cite Mat Kilau . I'm not weird . Like seriously , is there a Malay movie that I don't think is the best? nothing like that"
"Many local movies are the best . But Mat Kilau is not the best . Also , created by Malay supremacists . After that , I'm smart enough to think for myself , I don't want to be told"
"Those who curse this Mat Kilau film really hate the way of tweeting . It's like just watching the worst movie in my life . Maybe cursing people are trending , so many people join the party to get likes and retweets"

Fighting scenes in Mat Kilau movie was a
Really bitter twitter boy with Mat Kilau . There is no psal in the movie but he is bitter with his own people ahhaha . Pity . Born Malay can change to another race

My Netflix is also dusty , because no one wants to rummage through what movies it's best because there isn't any"
What a waste of your life if the movie doesn't Mat Kilau and you want to debate . 
There are a lot of famous Twitter clans tweeting about Mat Kilau . Even the liberal Malays on Twitter conspired to condemn the movie
It's crazy that Mat Kilau movies can be a debate here and there (can't find the popcorn emoji . Corn too
"Our views will always be different . The important thing is to ""keep going"" to produce a movie that benefits the community . Good job team Matt"
I wonder what you want to fight so much about

"Pd I , not only experts are eligible to comment . Maybe yes , he is not a film maker , but he always watches other people's movies and works to have enough benchmarks vs the hype . Eg , I am a copywriter by profession . But as I watch manyyyyy movies , I think Mat Kilau's presentation is still not umph , much"
"After this , if there is a movie like Mat Kilau , I will wait for netflix"
Why? Because paskal looks too personal . Mat Kilau may be too flashy and not to my preference . The Air Force brings goosebumps . It seems that the struggle to escape from terrorists and the personal character element does not overshadow the patriotism element of the
"What's wrong with mat kilau . . haiyaaaaa . . do you want a movie level like hollywood to mat? Haaa , I'm going to make a movie , will you see . . until it gets 10k collections? Erghhh . . so many songsehh"

"You're just a member of Netflix , you don't pay us , we pay for two months and free info for you bro , Netflix buys the movie Mat Kilau so its not FREE"
For me cite Mat Kilau is not perfect but to label this movie as bad is like not agreeing a little . . Who says this is bad I can say that people have very high expectations . . With collections up to 97 million so people remember cite Mat Kilau very much perfect &

"Anywaysss it's not bad , it's Mat Kilau and I don't understand why people give bad reviews but yeah it's people's opinions and yes I do think they still have a lot of room for improvements . I'm proud that msians are now taking steps to produce this kind of movie more than the rempit one so"

"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix , best , there is a standard . But it's not as good as Zhaf's review . He hyped the movie too much . Although 3/5"
"A lot of people downgrade Mat Kilau movies after they come out on Netflix . If you want to see , see , don't make noise"
"One of the factors behind the success of Mat Kilau was that Lightyears was not aired , nor was Thor . There is no competition from other movies for legs"
Are Mat Kilau the movie and Lawrence of Arabia of the same
"Kannnnn , I don't know , lately a lot of people are criticizing that Mat Kilau movie , but it's not good during the screening . "
can Mat Kilau do better? yes But it was
"It's true that Pramlee also makes period films using the standard language of his time , but the presentation of his time is better . but I swear this project is close to syamsul yusuf , for me he is good at popcorn movies and Mat Kilau shouldn't be popcorn movies"
for me Mat Kilau movie is exactly for the BMF
Is it really bad to watch the movie Mat Kilau? I didn't see it tonight . Because the member asked him yesterday
"Sis , because here , if we talk about other barbie movies , my personality is a little bubbly . so bear w me eh character is sis , it must be worse than the British character in mat"
A lot of people turned to foreigners after the release of the movie Mat Kilau
I don't know . . I don't even get money after fighting so hard . Just
"This Mat Kilau is for those who are interested in 100% action movies , they will really love it You really have to force your eyes and ears to watch this movie until it ends at the cinema"
"According to the movie Mat Kilau , you are the one who wants to fight , curse 7 generations . It's a movie . No one is forcing you to watch , this is not Japanese Kempitei forcing you to watch Nihon propaganda . The Producers are laughing their way to the bank , the more rowdy the more people watch the movie"
"I don't know , even for me the Mat Kilau is normal , but I give more credit after watching Zhaf's talk with Syamsul Yusof . When I saw syamsul explain , I understood that the movie should be able to go further , but there were many factors that prevented it , but syamsul still did his best . That's right"
"I've seen the Mat Kilau . Not the best . Air firce is not the best . Fortunately , I want to look at sukhoi so it's a little better . Overrated 2 movies"
"Yeah . So I think the opinion that you see on Netflix that Mat Kilau is the best is not wrong . The vibes you see on the stage & TV/phone screen are completely different . I tried to check the KKN in Desa Penari and I fell asleep . The general public knows that Netflix full movie . It's not like in the cinema , many scenes are cut here . "
Why doesn't it come out on netflix?
"What I can say is that people who watch Mat Kilau on Netflix are suddenly the greatest movie critic . Comparing with the best Hollywood movies . First , compare it with local films . It's a huge step up from the film Rempit &"
I didn't see the Mat Kilau . 
But we see still far away better than your silly movie like mat
Mat Kilau is an action comic book superhero movie . It's missing a grounded character who subtly breaks the 4th wall & it'd be perfect . Was laughing
I've seen Mat Kilau glitter in the cinema and on netflix In cinemas 3 . 5/5 On netflix 4/5 This movie makes martial arts look like this
100 million luster mat? Idk why collect that much but actually the movie is not that good . I'm glad I don't waste mine
Why do people write Japanese movie Mat Kilau . I'm a Malaysian
"The 2nd time I saw my children . . my mother also came up to give a lecture . . anything that reminds me of God is not Roblox . . that's why Mat Kilau is the best movie for me who is trying to understand about race , religion and"
"Mat Kilau 7/10 , Abang long fadil 6/10 . My opinion , why brother long fadil is 6/10 because it's cliche . I don't know how people can rate 9/10 . The movie cycle is just the same as the mat saleh movie and some parts are not quite right"
"I think the biggest turn off for the movie mat kilau tu is how inconsistent and different the way everyone talks . For a second speak basic Malay , for a second a bit modern . My brain can't enjoy the traditional vibe (??) they're trying to"
What is the solution for the next movie from criticism
ash
"I think they know Mat Kilau glitter because the movie has another name , who can remember . and some of them who people consider Malay warriors are actually 'landlords' to collect taxes . so when the British came to take over tax Mat Kilaurs , people started struggling . even though 2 times"
"Unpopular opinion . Mat Kilau is a propaganda movie for UMNO , PAS and other political groups that are based on Malay centric"
Have to say Mat Kilau is
"definitely not the worst we've seen in terms of filmmaking , but the message of the movie itself is the main problematic thing that some of us have been criticizing against . we for sure wouldn't want to see more of the agenda-pushing ideas of SY's mat kilau to be prevalent"
I've watched it for free on Netflix and then it's noisy . I'm thankful that the director is right that this movie is playing on Netflix . Do you know how big the budget is for this movie? Almost the same Hollywood level . Many are willing to fight for seats for the movie mat
All those who cursed Mat Kilau movie are those who just watched it on Netflix . . not those who watched it at the cinema . . Why eh?? Can anyone give a reasonable explanation
"If you cringe , don't worry . Alas . I can't see netflix JEEEE . If it doesn't come out on netflix , I don't know about this Mat Kilau movie . WEAK . Don't criticize let it be in the circle of people bro"
I will try giving a chance to Mat Kilau movie . tomorrow
"Movie is a form of art . And art , as we know , is subjective . So he's so eager to dictate what's best or not best on behalf of others that it's up to his throat . My opinion about Mat Kilau is only one , his camera work makes me dizzy"
"Had to say this since a lot of talking abt mat kilau , i get yall points by saying that movie needs a lot of improvement , but to say people who don't see that IQ is low or saying ""stupid people support umno"" are even more stupid connotation . Ckp other stupid people doesn't make u look brilliant"
mat kilau was good bro i don't really watch malay fighting movies and even malay movies in general and mat kilau was
"People might expect a director to release a small movie from that era , but if you make a movie like that , you'll get bored of that era and it doesn't suit the taste of today's kids . What's wrong with the director making a movie based on what Gen Z wants to see? hmm poor custom"
I don't want to review the movie Mat Kilau
"why are many people criticizing the Mat Kilau , for me the movie is ok and there is"
"Done look at the Mat Kilau 1- honestly , personally I would rate 5/10 for this movie . Kinda overrated but overall okay . 2- idk but this is just from my opinion as a viewer you know . I know I don't have knowledge in movies but I have to agree when people say the camera time action is amazing"
"Okay , since Mat Kilau movie is suddenly viral now , I want to review a little bit about the movie . I give it 6/10 . First of all , I like how the movie is about the historical of Malaya fighting British colonies . The point is there . But ofc la , there is a lot of the meh side of the"
Why do the people who comment on the Mat Kilau movie say that they watched the movie for free like that? Netflix has to pay subs . I'm going to watch netflix
I think Mat Kilau is much better than Thor 4 I don't think it's the same as you You guys are born straight into action
Race Supramacy Mat Kilau
"I don't understand if it's noisy , this Mat Kilau is over rated . I'm ok with that quote . That's the level of Malay movies . It's ok because I don't see it in a typical movie . Or a funny ghost movie that is obviously stupid . I want to expect like the Korean cite Mat Kilau that is lambert again"
"You all complaining about the movie Mat Kilau are bored because they keep giving ""speech"" etc . , if your race and religion are in danger you won't want to chat over coffee , what's the Mat Kilaur? Just take what people say as a reminder and"
"I'm not good at reviewing movies in the same way that I'm not very good at reviewing food . If I say it's not the best and it's not good , it's a bad category . Today , many people have a Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau look . I'm ready to watch the movie twice hahaha . And I still don't know"
I literally cried so hard watching mat kilau near the movie and yall wanna say that movie is bad bad? Maybe what is shown at the cinema is not the same at netflix because wtf icb
"My favorite moment was when Mat Kilau said ""It's Kilau Time"" and kilaued/defeated the British soldiers . Definitely one of the movies of all"
You enjoyed the movie ok . You're not enjoying it then ok too . To each their own . He turned away because he was tired of reading because he hadn't finished the chapter yet
"It's crazy how lively and beautiful this RRR movie is hahaha 3 hours , it's not lame like a dead man"
The anti-Malay thing is endless and turns to Mat kilau's movie review . Do not have
"I watched mat kilau when it first came out with my sister . Legit could not take the movie seriously because I look at adi putra , all I see is Jai from KL gangster . I can't hold in the laughter every time my mind makes the"
Many of them are biiter with movie mat kilau rilek
"The thing is , if it had been a GOOD movie based on Malay historical figures , it would have appealed to non-Malays as well . As if we all didn't learn about Mat Kilau in school? But it was deliberately made in such a way as to alienate"
"Just wondering , will Mat Kilau , the movie , be able to influence the masses in the upcoming GE 15? Is it significant enough to create sentiments among them"
Condemn Mat Kilau like
The one who commented (after watching it on Netflix) seemed to go to see Mat Kilau in the movie theater is a low IQ audience . . Turned to Malay . . It's about the movie that they are willing to insult other people . . This movie has a lot of holes but it's relaxing
"That day the members went to see Mat Kilau at the cinema . So yesterday I sent him a photo of Adam watching the movie . He replied , oh I know this movie . It's Mat something right? I'm tired friends with this dipping mat . He didn't register to vote after I went to Vietnam"
"i have seen a lot of negative comments towrds Mat Kilau and honestly everyone can have their own opinion right? so imo , there's no harm in liking that movie eventho its fictional but we all know the fact that Mat Kilau is"
People who like low-budget movies would probably like Mat Kilau and believe it's the greatest thing that's ever happened since their standards are so low . Mat Kilau is simply
M
"These few days , many people are less interested in Mat Kilau shown on netflix & comment about the movie . "
He's the guy playing
"Matt movie is not the best , save money , I don't watch the movie with the action scene , the camera man is shaking , the shooting is martial arts too"
"Not going to even bother watching Mat Kilau . The decline of the Malaysian movie industry is as clear as day . We have stopped learning , stopped innovating , stopped trying . We have the best neighbors (eg . Indo , Thailand) to learn from , but no , we reward"
You look at the movie and it doesn't Mat Kilau
Forget about other people's art . . the way I give my opinion can be accepted with the highest Mat Kilau film sales in Malaysia so far
"I don't know why watching a movie can tell people's IQ . If you think Mat Kilau is not the best , just say it's not the best , it's not your taste . But if you want to judge the IQ of the person who watched it based on 1 movie , he said it was the best"
I love all these reviews about Mat Kilau on FB that movie is just
"Mat Kilau is really bad but ITS devil worshipers are different bro , so sorry we have better"
"Sorry i can't give my review for Mat Kilau yet , because the one that is on Netflix rn is just a 2-hour long epic movie trailer . . I believe the actual movie will be released"
"Look , this movie is supposed to unite the Malays , this is dividing the Malays even more"
A lot of people have arrived
Mat kilau is a normal movie for me . But it's not too bad . The earnings of this film can reach 90 million . But you don't need to be the smartest to criticize . You record a selfie video of yourself pom shaking . I want to criticize
Finally being able to watch Mat Kilau after Netflix broadcast it starting yesterday . In my honest opinion even though got a lot of things to improve it's still a great
"Mat kilau is a movie to watch once , not repeat many times . But this movie is not very bad like the netizens criticize . No need to comment badly to criticize people who don't care about your tweet . You don't know the pom who hates that"
"Why is Mat Kilau's time in movies mostly rated 8/10 , 9/10 , 100/10 . . But when it's on Netflix , people rate 2/10 , -3/10?? Ready to finish one movie in 3 days . Just plan to see it tomorrow"
Kakakakaka mende lah bekap movie mat
The name of the movie is not diary mat kilau and friends . Don't show that stupidity on social media . Shy
That's why many uncertified movie reviewers were born after the luster
"I will indeed compare it to Merong Mahawangsa because that movie is the best despite having a movie years ago . the ending is also satisfied , not messy . There is no conclusion to this Mat Kilau . It looks very rushed , like you MUST make a movie below 2"
What's the fuss about the Mat Kilau movie btw? Everything is bad . N the lack of extras in each scene just shows that the movie is bad . Really
"If I'm not mistaken , when Mat Kilau came out of the cinema , everyone like , 'it's good' , 'great movies' and whatever . And then Netflix came out , everyone gave bad reviews? What"
Mat Kilau is one of those movies that you love watching the first time and would absolutely hate watching it the second time
tl today all discuss issues
Is Mat Kilau really that bad of a movie? (Seriously
I only watched the first 5 minutes of mat kilau to already know what's the rest of the movie gonna be like . And it's not what I expected at all based on the sales it made when it arrived
"If you want to give your opinion , you don't want to quote Malay , you can put a polite comment , comment with manners , it's ready to mention a movie for people with a low IQ , how can you lose your manners just by watching the movie Mat Kilau? Watch out today , everyone is trying hard to be the Zhafvlog"
"Mf be like Mat Kilau is a 3/10 and compare it to IP Man when the Malaysian movie track record is Evolusi KL Drift , Impak Maksima and Bini-Biniku"
"What's the case with people raging about Mat Kilau? Relax . Like is subjective . Some like it some don't . It's okay to back up too much or curse too much . To me , can be 1 of my favorite patriotic movies besides Bukit Kepong & Lieutenant"
"None , we watch Mat Kilau and other action/horror"
"comment a little bit about the Mat Kilau film movie . there is something more like him tering everything , turning away"
"Since Mat Kilau has been on netflix , many people have made reviews . . it's like I collected tens of millions , but reviews like this movie are almost too much . . I'm waiting for Air Force to come on netflix , I want to read a review , is there anyone who agrees with it?"
I think people are expressing their disappointment on mat kilau because we rarely get a biopic movie about national heroes . Last time was lieutenant Adnan? Decades later it just got a Mat Kilau (correct me if im wrong) so they expect something wow in
"Done watching the most viral and hype movie ever this year , Mat Kilau . Although it was super cringe but not bad for an Asian producer . I would rate"
there's no end to the Mat Kilaur of Mat Kilau . Those people are already rich . wait . watch the movie . haha . What are you talking about on Twitter?
1 month ago we have supporters who went absolute total blind die hard support on Mat Kilau as if that was the best Malaysian movie ever . Now we have detractors who criticize the movie frame by frame like it's total
"Uwow just realized there's a lot of prejudices on Mat Kilau movie . From the historical aspects of the movie , I think there is not much to be learned as this is not a biography . But to say the movie is for ""Malays with low IQ"" is too"
"Where are you? I don't like all movies . But before this Mat Kilau movie started , someone wrote to tell me that this movie is just fiction . Not round and round follow . Some have also been changed . That's what he meant . You're not focused , you want to talk to me . That's a lot to see"
Defo not . i don't watch movies much and Mat Kilau is really fine
"For me , the luster is normal and I don't have a problem with you being the best because other people have different tastes . But I don't understand that the movie has been in theaters for a long time , ready to collect 100 , 000 , and now people want to criticize it . When it's airing , there's no fuss like this"
"Thank you for your review . But you know how the effort to make the old historical to become a movie? That is not easy to satisfy everyone , but for me Mat Kilau is the best Malay movie that we can watch to remember the services of our heroes"
"Akhi , we want to be alerted , follow Al-Kuliyyah TV3 . It's more appropriate in a knowledge ceremony like that from the movie Mat Kilau This is my advice for you , brother . Don't have a few verses of the Quran in the movie , I was shocked . That's called lack of soul filling"
"Actually , if you want to criticize Mat Kilau or like Mat Kilau , it's okay . What movie is wrong?"
"What am I talking about? Do you watch movies like this , do you have an artistic soul? Since when can a movie with an artistic soul make money? If there aren't many rich art people It's either They make it fun or They ride the sentiment . Mat Kilau is the"
"Just watched MAT KILAU in netflix . It was a nice movie to watch and get to learn who you are , where are you coming from , where should you stand and why Mat Kilau wanted to save the land so badly , there is a lyrics stated in Negaraku . 4 . 5 cause the ending . . finished"
"Okay , it's everyone's opinion about the Mat Kilau finish , but if"
Finally watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . Let's just say I'm very glad I watched it and wasn't swayed by the reviews from back home . Not to mention the scandal surrounding the movie that had nothing to do with
"When people bring up the issue of Mat Kilau , they just noticed why this year not many people share the independence video for Malaysia Day . There is only one . I always see two or three shorts"
I rather watch Ratsasan (Tamil movie) for the 6th time than watch Mat Kilau for the 2nd
First 10 mins of Mat Kilau is making me how'd
"After months of people talking about the movie Mat Kilau ritu , today I can only watch it after going to Netflix . I rarely go to the movies later for sure"
"I'm the only one who doesn't watch the Mat Kilau drama/movie at the cinema . And even when it's free on Netflix , it still doesn't work"
Matt
Mat Kilau is a
"I also think mat kilau should make a telemovie or movie close to ASTRO first , seriously overrated . For me brother syamsul should've done a lot better than"
"Mat Kilau , good movie if you're watching it for the"
tiber so many dislikes
tiber so many dislike for Mat Kilau
"People see Mat Kilau near the cinema because of the hype from people who say it's the best . . . I went to the movies with my sister , I also watched . Wtf , not even worth the hype . Just an average movie with horrible fighting scenes"
"Sooo Mat Kilau is it that bad? I read that some people turn off the TV , change to another movie after 10 , 20"
After watching it on netflix . . for me this movie is overrated . . air force movie again
"Thanks Netflix for showing the movie Mat Kilau . . with all the hype goin on , our family excited with this movie when it released . . we watched yesterday the whole family , and after 30 minutes of the movie , my mom literally zzzz . . . . it shows whatâ€¦â€¦ (fill in the"
the sentence . . . will you see elvis next week? until I can't see it like this . . . wait for the movie to appear on hotstar or netflix last2 mat kilau appear on netflix
Translating
Last night I watched Mat Kilau on Netflix hmmm I still don't understand why people talk about that movie
You don't like the idea of a comedian taking her veil off to make a joke? Don't watch the video . You dont like an ethnonationalist Shamsul Yusof movie? Don't watch Mat Kilau . Spare yourself the unnecessary stress that you're putting your body
"Instead of making a Mat Kilau , it's better to make a movie for other characters , such as tok elephant to tok beard to dato maharajalela to . . directors in Malaysia don't be lazy"
Day 509 since the making of FOTD: Currently watching Mat Kilau (again) over on netflix . . and yeah it's no wonder peeps don't vibe with it . It's a mess . It'd be a good movie if it actually resonated with the people but as you see . . . there are some that
Malay but
"RM55 per month for example . Divide by how many movies and dramas there are . Plus , don't you want to face Mat Kilau every day? It's true that the souls of Malay warriors will die later . "
who doesn't like to watch movies mat kilau must jump the school fence during subject time
"Tolak tepi mat kilau best ka not best . . . but all this mat kilau tweets making mat kilau trending again on twitter timeline . The marketing team is shocked . You're the best , you're not the best , finally the name of the Mat Kilau movie is viral and trending as well . Mat Kilau 1 - Netizens"
I think my comment is good . That's also insulting Have faith in
"This film is Mat Kilau , I think I'm so busy swearing at the British that I don't notice what people are criticizing . But his camera"
Agreed . There are woke Malays who just hate anything about the Malays . And nowadays it's woke to insult the Malay movies esp . mega box office movie Mat Kilau . Perhaps
It's bad that the luster got stuck hahaha luckily I never felt like watching it from the start . A movie that only caters the Malays indeed if you watch this movie for sure I'd leave my ass after 10 mins into the
Showing Mat Kilau on Netflix has become the movie to show to a large number of people/relatives who came to your home so you don't have to interact with
I don't know why people don't like Mat Kilau? The movie is so good and the fact the movie is based on truth
"Many cytros give bad reviews about Mat Kilau , or Mat Kilau movies that don't meet other people's tastes and expectations to me , mat kilau is a very good movie want to say five stars , no , four stars already"
I watched mat kilau yesterday on netflix . As expected . Hence I rarely watch Malay movies
Actually Syamsul already admitted some mistakes in the movie Mat Kilau in his press conference . And he didn't expect the net worth will
"Yesterday I watched the movie Mat Kilau with my family . I'm just my wife , I skip making coffee , playing games aha . Bored! It's good that I wasn't fooled by the movie ""review"" from twidder . Remember the last Malay movie I saw at the cinema , Mimpi Dilaila . . ughh how stupid was that"
"movie mat kilau time stamped 1:48:51 , when kilau got a sword , what did he do to rest , because Wahid was the opponent"
what does liking Mat Kilau have to do with getting it back? Even the movie is relaxing . A lot of people hesitate when watching LGBT movies because they are afraid of reality . but Mat Kilau film itself also wants to relate to reality . its just a fvcking movie . 
remind cite biography . even though there is absolutely no mention of the main character . well put the title of the movie 'Ini Tanah Kami' . not 'Mat Kilau' . Awang's character stands out from the characters
"Naturally , it's a blockbuster movie . Imagine a Mat Kilau film only 100k people watched . Maybe 1-10% don't like it , haters . We think many people like this movie because only 1-10k say it's boring/trash . But if 6 million people watch it . This movie has already 600k words"
"First of all , I think your IQ is very high , syamsul use one ""character"" to raise the religion of Islam and don't forget Mat Kilau is a person who is fluent in tassawur , that's why syamsul included the element of ""SPEECH"" in this movie . This movie is in Malay , it can be wrong"
The ones who comment & review like turning away from the taste of movie directors with the hope that Mat Kilau is in line with the films that can enter the Oscars . . . phuuiii That's how the man who supposedly has everything in his head is the greatest on social media . I don't know if I saw the teaser
Even the movie article wants to fight . It's sad to see Malays like this . Why didn't the British say Malays should unite . Even the movie article
"Haha . . many comments -ve been watching mat kilau @ netflix . I like it btw . I rarely watch Malay movies , to be exact . Syamsul knows his crowd . He knows how to tackle them . That's why his movie is rare x millionÂ² . Ppl will have diff"
Not finished with this Mat Kilau article? Change the topic . I still can't understand why the movie Thor - Love and Thunder can't go to the cinema
I would also like to evaluate the Mat Kilau movie . But later . Come on
"there are hundreds who disagree with you . If you don't like it , fine . Is it necessary to put others' preference down? People harp on Parasite & make comparison Parasite vs Mat Kilau . Heck . I fast forwarded the movie to the ending cos it bored me . Did I make fun of the Academy?"
"hahahha but it's really Mat Kilau and not the best , if you want to mess around in the middle of a movie"
"All people have different genes , so movie preferences may vary . IMO , the film Mat Kilau is not at the level of a trash film so Zhaf does not swear . Most of the films criticized by Zhaf seem to the eyes of ordinary viewers to say that the film is level"
"Tonight I want to have a movie night with Fitrie to watch the Mat Kilau . just look at the doc dang , "
So if you look at Mat Kilau near netflix
Perhaps prev good and critical movies are not associated with him because he does not promote the film too much like how he promotes Mat
"What he is not satisfied with is actually when actual good and critical movies don't get a response and he attributes it to the reason for the good rating at Mat Kilau . this is just a Mat Kilaur of opinion , open for debate and"
This Inspector Lim is from the time of the movie lieutenant adnan until the movie matt kilau he side
"MAT KILAU im not condemning but my view of that movie , 2 . 5/5 stars . . so many elements are wrong . I don't see it myself . . the author is more netizens"
"I think Mat Kilau is just a normal movie . Turn off the cameraman , he has severe Parkinson's"
"You don't care , the movie is understandable and respected . Heck , I've even criticized the Mat Kilau movie . But with endless sentences ""it's suitable for Malays"" why? Are you not Malay? Are you saying you're not like most Malays?"
"I love to cry when I watch a movie , 5 minutes"
"not blaming yall for saying Mat Kilau movie is bad , but why tf some of yall gotta make fun of SyamsulYusof and hate him for no reason?? mad respect cuz he put a lot of effort in the movie and he didnt even hurt yall , chill tf out yall need to"
"Grant , I think that if you want to promote it as one of the movies that promote martial arts and the Malay psyche , then that would be appropriate . Even Bunohan is more appropriate than Mat Kilau for me even though it's not really an action movie , but more like it"
"Okay , I've seen Mat Kilau on Netflix . Basically it's a movie for boys . The simple one"
Mat Kilau movie
"Our people are indeed toxic (liver problems) . Give a comment Mat Kilau , it's the first time to do it . It's not like this is his 100th historical movie . Each comment is like an expert in movies . For constructive comments . Relax-relax"
Mat Kilau is good actually . Mat salleh has a lot more movies except the one
"How many months has it been since the movie came out last month , now it's on neflix . "
Interesting to read the comments of the audience version of the Mat Kilau movie
"Mat kilau is a bad film/movie Which colonizer wants to tell what is the weakness of the country/nation he colonized? Besides in Mat Kilau . Never ending from the beginning ""kaymu maylayu berpeciah baylah . "" Cringed"
"Conclusion , Mat Kilau is a bad but good fictional popcorn movie . Had to stop this movie as a historical movie coz too many unclear facts , clearly . Lastly , it's glitter"
"I've seen the Mat Kilau movie that day . But because of many comments after entering Netflix before , I want to enter the scene too . Yes! It's not the best! As a comparison , I can say that Air Force The Movie is better even though some people say that the action is lacking . But at least it's not hyped"
"As long as I didn't see this Mat Kilau , I tried to keep an open mind but I can't help comparing this movie to certain historical movies from Indonesia such as Kartini , Bumi Manusa etc . Indonesians have other standards"
"For movies , everyone has different taste when it comes to a movie . Some say that Mat Kilau is the best , some say it's almost , some say it's not the best . If you don't like it , why are you still watching? And yeah , one more thing , cursing and yelling doesn't even give us power , it looks like we're stupid"
"i guess that was just personal opinion bcs i assumed by watching clips/films back then , i thought people in the past didn't talk like THAT ahahahah , to me it was just cringy as i was hoping Mat Kilau to be an extraordinary movie for"
The one who condemns that luster
"It's wrong to say that our film doesn't get support , while you yourself say that our film (Mat Kilau kilau) is for millions . Of course , the majority of our people support our movie"
"I just finished Mat Kilau today , the movie is fine , it can be 5/10 , it's bland for me , but I understand the message of fighting spirit to convey"
For me Mat Kilau not
It's good Mat Kilau borak Space . Convinced me not to watch the
"Returning from Amimek's house , I went to the night market in the mountain with heavy rain , waiting for the satay to cook , then continue that night to see the glittering Mat Kilau of the neighboring houses . It's good to continue 1 more movie . All kinds of pain"
"I want to argue about Mat Kilau . this movie is subjective . if you don't like it , tweet once and then shut up"
The Mat Kilau is movie average and not very wow . But at least we know that Malay warriors are great . I agree with the shaky camera
The title of the movie Mat Kilau but we learned nothing about Mat Kilau except he's
"I admit there are flaws . But there are still many good things . So , to those who have reviewed the Mat Kilau . Continue to support other Malay movies and give more reviews . Don't stop at the Mat Kilau because"
"Who here is willing to pay rm25 to watch Malay movies?? Haha , I'm ready to watch kimchi for you at the cinema , you know . . . how much I enjoy Malay movies . From this Mat Kilau movie I see the improvement of Malay movies"
"Malaysia day , Mat Kilau movie on netflix . Once again , there are many people who review Mat Kilau . It's worse for people . Be ready to say ""maybe I have high expectations"" . Bro , people have already reviewed the movie many times , you can expect it . I'm not bitter like he says"
Mat Kilau movie really good . . I suggest
Open netflix right now to see what the hype is all about . Just 15 minutes of the movie and then watch Shippuden . 
"This is like a very good time to watch mat kilau coz the queen just die and the movie shows how bad the colonizer british treat our country/people , , how they tried to profit of our natural"
"Mat Kilau is on netflix , it's over , people"
What is this mat kilau movie . . . 10 mins in and i gave up . Look if I wanted to listen to a ceramah I can easily look for any misogynist Ustaz ceramah on youtube
"Bro , he has already collected millions from this Mat Kilau movie . people don't even care"
Why do those who watch Mat Kilau on Netflix turn away and curse this Msia movie? This must be a species interested in Marvel movies
Haha that Mat Kilau appeals to the masses . Popular but doesn't mean to movie
It's like a Mat Kilau movie
"Many people say that this film is the best , ready to watch it 2-3 times . when you enter netflix , many people say no"
"I think , people use the Mat Kilau title just to attract the audience . Because the glittery character doesn't really stand out in this movie . This movie should be titled ""destroying the British in Ulu . """
"It's already on Netflix , I still don't want to watch Mat Kilau . During the first week of the movie , I chose to watch the Elvis movie . It's not because I'm not patriotic , but I want to see the best movie"
"It's true that each has an interest , but if the Mat Kilau , the praise is soaring , but when it comes to the Air Force , he says cringe , it's a bit suss . This is my opinion as a casual moviegoer"
"thank you Netflix for bringing Mat Kilau to my home TV . proven I did not waste my money/time to go to the cinema , I slept through the movie (thankfully in the comfort of my bed) , not my cup of"
Shoojit Sircar's big laugh
I know agree to disagree . Why are people so angry when they comment on the Mat Kilau movie? Chill already . Everyone has an opinion
"Maybe the problem is there , lack of public promotion . We have never heard of both movies , while Mat Kilau all out promote the movie . No wonder people claim the movie this time"
For me movie Mat Kilau x best But . . . if people like it . . . it's ok It's okay if people don't like me Preference for foreign tickets . . . byr Don't disagree . . . 
"BRO MAT KILAU WAS SO HYPED BRO , "
"Haven't seen an action movie in a while , watch it"
"Watching Mat Kilau rn . Half way through watching , I still don't understand what people are hype about"
We watched Mat Kilau tonight on Netflix . The first comment from mom after 15 minutes of the movie starting . Is that your husband? Amboi
I suspect that director Mat Kilau has never read the Brandstory book . Not following the movie principle
"Matt is not the best , it can be improved a lot if you want to make a historical movie . Luckily with netflix you can stop and continue , if you have a movie you may be asleep . One two jaga and dukun are the best , i"
"His concept is the same as Marvel & Multiverse . Multiverse is theory and Marvel only has fiction . But he has encouraged his fans to explore more physics and multiverse theory . Same as Mat Kilau . The luster of historical figures . This movie is fiction , but the Mat Kilau ofc will encourage people to explore"
"My sister is so excited to watch Mat Kilau . Hence , I let him watch the movie"
"What's the Mat Kilaur with Mat Kilau's sudden return haha? I'm talking about taste , review it , you want to drag a reviewer who likes the movie , what is it?"
literally watched mat kilau for the first 15 mins and it felt so much like watching a movie for
"I mistakenly watched a video about Mat Kilau film . I can't watch the scene where there are machetes , shooting shooting . . . stabbing everyone . Throbbing . "
"Lek zhaf , he remembers his point of view , people want to hear it , I don't hype this film , but I don't object to the point of view of people who like it , it's like if you eat nasi lemak with melted cheese , then you say that people who don't eat it are bullshit , haha"
T
I still like the language in the movie Merong Mahawangsa compared
A lot of people look at Netlfix to comment on the Mat Kilau movie . The 89 million look at it all ok . 
What a movie review
He praises it
"agree . . this movie is good , this rise is 10x from the Mat Kilau . . it makes all the hairs Mat Kilau"
In conjunction with Malaysia Day . I watched a movie marathon today . Mat Kilau . Sarkar . Naayak . dial
Just looked at the Mat Kilau . Just watch and enjoy . Too lazy to comment . Very many
"Haha , people on twitter condemned the movie as bad . Haha . The technical aspects of the movie are not good , but that's it , I still support the idea of the movie"
"I don't see the Mat Kilau , half of the movie I lost the opponent with the Mat Kilau , I understand it myself . Hahahaha , now I'm wondering how there are people who see it so many times at the movies?"
The gang just watched the movie Mat Kilau on Netflix and are busy trying to give a review
"like this try not to look at mat kilau as merely a ""movie"" that"
Mat Kilau! it's a historical movie that's really good and it's out on our netflix~ really recommend it if you have the chance to watch
"Comparing historical movies vs soap operas . Sinetron is only for tv and most of them are low budget , but this Mat Kilau with more budget and based on historical event but looks like"
Depends on the situation of the scene . Try to watch the transformers or any other action movies . . The camera shakes a lot during the action scenes . This is what they applied in Mat Kilau and air force
"a lot of people say that this Mat Kilau movie has a lot of shocks during the fight scene . . . . maam air force , the movie is still dizzy , do you know the camera movement?"
"done with no Mat Kilau . even lambertt hahah . if you see it at the movies , it's best . but that's it . My son wants to put this mano at home , he is busy going around the house when people are watching movies"
Bad film Mat Kilau here criticism with
"Apsal laaa who tweets and cites that Mat Kilau . . a western movie that doesn't make sense , you can plak accept and praise melambung . . for me it's not bad la malay movie is already as good"
"""Peh Mat Kilau on Netflix ah"" Then I opened it to watch the tmnt animated movie hahaha I wasn't interested after watching the trailer that day again"
The first time I watched Zhaf's movie review video was because I wanted to know if the movie Orphan First Kill was okay . hmm sorry The original video is there . Many people should be disappointed that Mat Kilau's review is beautiful but the reality is . . . hmm it sucks . 
"This is not an honest review problem , but a personal problem but a project with a Mat Kilau movie . Mcm"
"I don't know if I really like this kind of movie genre , but Mat Kilau is a masterpiece of Malaysia"
"Look at Mat Kilau , even bitter . I understand the movie very well"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau on netflix . . . a very good movie , well done . . . can skip"
mat kilau is already near netflix . . I don't know when to watch the movie
"I'm lucky I don't see the Mat Kilau again , it's ok"
"That's right , if the movie had expired regardless we have downloaded it still cannot watch . But mat kilau en , might be there on the list for a while God willing if you want to finish it"
"I love seeing people commenting on Mat Kilau that it is now on Netflix . That day I said , Mat Kilau , it's not good for anyone to bash me , because I'm not patriotic . Lol it has nothing to do w/ patriotism , mmg the movie needs major revamping before I can say it's acceptable . He didn't follow"
I need
"Btw , I don't watch mat kilau on netflix because my mom said it's crazy that she watches movies . What's wrong? At the beginning of the scene , he was jumping between the logs , but the logs had already been released before he jumped . I lost my expectation with this movie . The last fight was good , the guerilla suddenly ambushed stupidly like that 10"
"It's right that many people say that Mat Kilau film is the best , it's really the best , it doesn't make me cry"
"Mat Kilau is out on netflix , I'm tired of watching it"
Luckily he didn't die
F
I'm sure a lot of people will be disappointed with Mat Kilau film and wonder why people are so hyped
"I just installed this Mat Kilau a minute ago , it's like this throughout the movie , will there be something interesting later? lazy to throw away"
"Movies like puteri gunung ledang , lieutenant adnan and embun are better to watch than"
"Things that people may think are unnecessary but I want to change in Mat Kilau , right , during the early scene of the fighting chase to introduce the character , instead of covering the faces of Wahid , Awang & Brahim , it's better to cover the faces of Mat Kilau and then reveal them . The title of the movie is Mat"
Rewatching mat kilau with the famz . . . honestly this is the only Malay movie we can watch together
L
Why do I think the movie Mat Kilau is so 'bright'? And the
"I was sitting in front of the tv for almost 2 hours , watching Mat Kilau and yes it was a good movie . I haven't seen a Malay movie that is powerful in every bit of it for a long time"
SALAM SEJAHTERA TENGOH THE MOVIE MAT KILAU IS SUCH A FIRE FOR THE MALAY FIGHTERS IN MALAYSIA TODAY IS MALAYSIA DAY FORGET THE MOVIE PERJUNG MAT KILAU JUST SHOUT MALAYSIA CAN BE ROBBED IN THE COLONIES THE PEOPLE ARE WRONG
"It's true when they say , ""good or bad publicity , publicity is still publicity"" . Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . Tbh , it didn't live up to its hype . Bar the politics , this movie was boring and cringey . The storyline was flat . Can't believe this was actually compared to Ip"
Just watched mat kilau in netflixxx . Huwaaa the movie came mase EOP
treat
"Have you seen the movie Mat Kilau yet? It's out on Netflix today . If so , it's good to raise the flag back to half-mast"
Wow Mat Kilau has entered Netflix . I think the movie with the most quotes and the fastest entry
r
midnight movie for today: Mat Kilau finally got to see . . . me
Mat kilau in Indonesia does not get media coverage like any Indo movie that enters Malaysia!! The Malaysian media always supports every Indo work that enters Malaysia but the media in Indo does not do the same for the work
Where
"Air Force The Movie = Rm27 million (still showing) Film Mat Kilau = Rm97 million Abang Long Fadhil's movie = Rm10 million (still showing) Total = Rm134 million Who says Malaysians don't support Malaysian Films . The important thing is the best film , promotion should be done"
"Mat Kilau was my first Malay movie after more than 10 years (the last time I watched a Malay movie was ombak rindu) After watching Mat Kilau , I would never go to the cinema just to waste my money for the local"
"I was crazy skeptical when I booked to see ATMOS . But , to my own surprise , the opening was awesome . Like . Ooooommmmgggggg . I'm in love . Either I didn't watch Mat Kilau or this movie is awesome . I do not know . But I rate 5 . My sister is so confused by that one character that she freaks out"
"Mat kilau and airforce the movie is supposed to feature an elite group of people , tactical in thinking and well versed in methods to dispose of enemies . However both movies had its climactic final fight taking place in an open field . I would like to understand the rationale of"
"What's the political message behind this new movie , exactly"
honestly malaysia should just focus on this kind of movies mat
"It's kinda ironic that the Mat Kilau movie goes on about how bad the British were , but then it preaches Malay nationalism which is a byproduct of Britain's failure to properly assimilate the non-Malays with the indigenous Malay"
"after the hyped movie mat kilau , Pahang's heroes against the British , Pahang finally flew the flag at half-mast in honor of the death of the empire's ruler"
You should watch the movie about Mat kilau and you'll see
People are tired of making Mat Kilau movies against colonialists . The movie is ready to break the screening record . . . But there are also a few Malaysians who still lick the ass of the former colonialists . Amused
So
I don't want . . . facts
Like no
"The thing . . that's the purpose of the movie , from people who don't know about Mat Kilau to know . I will not watch the movie without taking into account his sacrifice"
It looks like this anti-British sentiment is different from the post-season of the Mat Kilau movie . It is appropriate for the government to pull Malaysia out of the Commonwealth of Nations if it prioritizes populist views
"You guys are hyped about Mat Kilau because there is a movie about him , right? if there isn't even a little bit , I don't want to know about Mat Kilau , basically"
So the Mat Kilau movie is just to make fun of other nations? Oh cam
Movie Mat Kilau has reached rm90 million in a day . You can continue watching
h
Nobody
"still insane to me Mat Kilau passed endgame in sales LMAO . not that endgame is a cinematic masterpiece , but mat kilau able to harness melayu keris energy . My parents went to see the puppet show! last time they went to the movies was back 06 kot , bullying"
I'm getting confused . . . . What is the purpose of screening the movie Mat Kilau
sorry malay movies never got a place in
I don't think I have to mention how unexplainable everything is in the air force . I have a lot of questions and no answers at the end of the movie . Same as Mat Kilau . And this is not even comparing them to top guns . Serious zero rating for air
"Sorry but after watching air force and mat kilau , Malay writers need to step up or just make drama movies . Redha and pulang are seriously one of the best movies I've"
air force the movie <3333 wayyyy tooo goodddd deserves more hype just like paskal and mat kilau 100% recommended!!! cried twice at the end of the movie hihi everyone so hot and handsome but adi putra my fav encemmmm angattt
Just watched Lieutenant Adnan on Netflix and my conclusion (again for the hundredth time) is:- IT IS 10000000x BETTER THAN MAT KILAU AND IT WAS PRODUCED IN THE YEAR 2000!!! Lieutenant Adnan was and is still the benchmark . Learn from this please @/Directors who want to make war
"Totally agree . It's rubbish when you tell our people to watch Malay movies , people reply , eeiii . . . I'm not used to watching Malay movies . . . I don't know what's going on in my heart . . . I'm so confused that I've turned to Malay"
His color grading is the best bro . First time watching a movie
"That day , in conjunction with independence , he rented a lot of ramps , daggers , clothes in conjunction with the film's Mat Kilau The mcd kangar staff also rent for the 31st"
"The patient is a 10-year-old boy who comes to wear a brace , does not want to open the tooth extraction time . After seeing Mat Kilau ready to stop studying Taekwondo , take up martial arts . When we want to poke him he's afraid , we're close to him Mat Kilau where he's afraid , keep opening his mouth as wide as possible Really good influence"
"Why aren't many people excited about this Anak Rimau movie? I think Anak Rimau is more attractive than Air Force & Mat Kilau Look at Anak Rimau , you really have nothing to lose"
Personally for me Air Force The Movie - Selagi Bernyawa is a better movie than Mat
"Airforce the movie is also the best . A new leap I think in the Malaysian film war genre . I am sure that after Mat Kilau and Airforce the movie , there will be many more war or historical movies that can compete with Hollywood movies from the genre"
People won't hesitate to spend money on local movies if it's as good as and also Mat Kilau . I also like this one a lot better than
"Easter (10/10) Mat Kilau (9/10) Air force the movie (8/10) BAKARA Police Evo 3 If you want to watch Malaysian movies , you really like action movies , hahaha love love or ghosts , but I don't know if I like it"
"Air Force The Movie is not bad , technically better"
"Invite the people to boycott the upcoming box office movies that will be released soon.Don't forget that the movie industry is also their biggest contributor,what's more, the movie Wonder Woman clearly shows the perpetrators of the Jewish race. Try to see the movie in the Mat Kilau country box office in our country alone, how much has it collected."
"always proud of what our nation can achieve. I support local films. To do better we need to compete productively. In this era, the source of movies is limitless. Ola Bola, Mat Kilau to name a few are all local blockbusters. Give it sometimes for local films to grow."
"about reading a book to know this history, I once talked to someone who saw the movie Mat Kilau and completely believed what he showed. when I told him to read a book, he said Idon't know Malay.I'm too lazy to debate with people who want to go to the toilet"
MALAYSIANS remember when we were all obsessed over Mat Kilau(themovie)? especially the girls when we thought some of the 6 casts were
remind me there is a parade from the cast of the movie eramalat cuz last year there was a mat
Idon't thinkthat's the reason. The people are now ready to vote.. nonsensical stories have no essence. What do you want tosupport? Example of movie mat
"Tbh right now, you gimme one podium and i read out what i have, i sound like im in the mat kilau movie"
"In my experience doing startup is investors will put money in ventures that they can relate with. So I guess FINAS people are those who like these kinds of movies, not Star Wars, Shutter Island and Mat"
"Where? We were in MMU Theater competitions together. Perempuan Itu(long time no TV especially Malaydrama) is itIsma's? For years I never followed, last Malay stories I watched was Mat Kilau& the aviation movie"
"Ermm.. it feels like there are many free tickets at mat kilau.. I got free tickets at mat kilau 4 times.. police evo 3 twice.. Ihaven't been able to get this anwar untold story becauseit's fun to run out of free ones.. just like any free movieI've ever had Idon't know hahahah.. ifit's possible,I'll do it like this for another movie"
"So movie bangnon with Mat Kilau, whereelse? Dialogue, story line,"
"Why did I think ofBell? Hahahaha eheh Beto in Mat Kilau. After the movie, he eclipsed everyone1 I think. This Raya, his face iseverywhere! + The star moon& the sweet fat song are over"
"Mat Kilau, the first movie in my life. Soo next we wait, Malbat Mission Bakara | Black Hawk Down. If history he follows what America and the West write. Auto"
"because Idon't know you very well, not because of race. If Chin View is making a movie with Mat Kilau and YusofHaslam's son or the devil boy actor,what's thepoint? lol. like the case of shooting a pregnant wife, because the perpetrators are not female so there is no hype.That's because of him"
last got a movie leak story mat kilau full movie looks like it looks like
"In terms of history and heritage, there seems to be no promotion while Pahang could have ride on the Mat Kilau movie and sell Kg Pulau Tawar as a tourism object. Sell Ulu Cheka via Pawang Noh a lesser known legend. There is a Pawang Noh Gallery in Ulu Cheka that is not on the tourism"
"Some kuning likes to make plots, Raja Abdullah for example. The regiment may be a plot just like how Javanese joined Heiho during Jp occupation there, then used the combat skills to fight against imperialists. But watching Mat Kilau movie followed by Lt. Adnan movie is just"
"I think EEAAO is also a story that if a fan of the Mat Kilau movie sees, he will not understand and will not"
Imaginary. One of the movies Icouldn't sleep this year. Solid like the second Malay story Ididn't sleep after the luster. Maybe BetoKusyairi's and DianaDanielle's acting will be right. Ican't sleep because everything is a problem and unpredictable.
"Some people say thatAnwar's untold story is not to be believed because there may be additions to make the story more beautiful.that's the end of the Mat Kilau story,that's very true. just relax both of them"
The target market of this story is not just Malaysia. Production is also from Indonesia. Want to compare with Mat Kilau is not relevant. The movie isAction/Drama. Not biographical
if you want to compare with random Malaysianmovies: Sa Balik Baju is far and away the best Bunohan is far and away the best Chow Kit is the best KL Gangster is far and away the best Mat Kilau not sure Istanbul here icome! by far the best(peak Beto
"Listen to the story, this movie IMAM wants to fight MatKilau's narrative. But with many comments, people say the quality is far from heaven and earth(Mat Kilau morepower) So, you have to see it to find out"
Why is it thatImaginur's storydoesn't get MatKilau'sresponse? Malaysians like movies that are simple anddon't have to think a lot
"Malay: some randomHooligan: Whydon't Malays take care of their own culture and throw it away for the sake ofreligion?Malay: make a Mat Kilau movie, do it as an effort to preserve cultureHooligans: FASCIST, RACIST, FACIST FACIST, RACIST"
"I like the hype forwahid/beto after mat kilau movie, like moon bintang and pakmat western"
I remember MatKilau's story... I started a verbal war cursingnon-Malays...non-Malaysdidn't watch the movie...didn't like the behavior
what's going on in thismovie? Do you remember that there is only 1 genre of movies like MatKilau? make a story about hackers with more power than this softporn movie. those who do it are not Malay like me. there are Malays who do that
"Never liked his movies.I've only seen one, Mat Kilau(only for BetoKusyairy) I hate it when the men keep saying""lu gua lugua"".It's true that I directly taught you.. All time banned from me"
"Me joining thehype: Never watch Mat Kilau. Even whenit's on Netflix. Not because of him. Because no longer feeling the need to watch movies anymore. Used to be a movie fan, a fan of the latest movies.Now?I'd rather"
"Rarely watch his movie too, if not mistaken""MatKilau"" either produced or directed by him andhe's the son of Yusof Haslam, a veteran actor in Malaysian movie industry... dare not to register marriagehere? Haha, why not ifit's in accordance with sharia law and"
Sorry ifwomen's emotions are disturbed but definitely no moreSol's movie in my list. Even Mat Kilau Idon't see anymore. I do not know.Don't do that to your wife. Hopefully
There is no descendants of meleis dajjal in the Indonesian government btw meleis music on spotify indon also when will it enter the top50????? When will the movie meleis goforward? Movie Mat Kilau like controversy wkwkwkwkthat's at least 1 and
"Yes, but the situation of these two movies is quite different. Mat Klaau is viral because it has a historical connection, so many smart people are smart enough to take the port because they can talk about it(also because ofSY). Mechamatodoesn't have much to talk about for going viral like MK other thanit's a successful Monsta product"
"""Hawa likes the History Subject after watching the Movie MatKilau""..""Hajar likes history after mom tells stories from the80s"" Camner wants to give children who like Math"
i know some fans kept saying its fictional and not meant to be historically accurate THEN WHY EVEN MAKE
Imagine if the mechamato movie came out at the same time as the Mat Kilau story. The powertho!! There are more and more people going uphill to fight
"Lol im just telling from a different perspective, for example mat kilau- how accurate isit? Or even hollywood movie black hawk down.. im not saying ur wrong, its just different"
"On tiktok, there is a video showing the flag, but the audio of Adi Putera is in the Mat Kilau movie. Those who agree with that video still want to live in the same place"
"Idon't know why, I miss Yasmin Ahmad and her film. Detoxing myself with her movie after just a brief moment with Mat Kilau. We need an inclusive story that shows true Malaysian spirit and"
"Nice story, the film is not historically correct. And then make Malays feel inferior"
"Wei, why arrest Muyi and others, also the Mat Kilau movie director. Because he is a person, this is all happening. Arrst them under the Act"
The one who chatted and looked at this Mat Kilau made me feel bad. Do not read the history of that luster other than
"honestly,I've never seen MatKilau's story ahhaha soI'm clueless as to what this tiktok boy is talking about MatKilau's movie"
"Yes,it's wrong, if people campaign in a healthy way anddon't raise religious sentiments,won't young people be so influenced that they want to say that peopledon't like Mat Kilau movies,right? People who are blind to the history of people who know the movie are dull"
Ican't blame the Mat Kilaute film tbh. bcit's relevant to that point of time. Malays were really struggling back then.don't nitpick history for your own
"Chat against people who watch Mat Kilau but vote for PH. Mat Kilau is against the colonialists. Ahfool! You know Mat Kilau from the movie, youdidn't study history"
"Over and over again, there are movies with Mat Kilau,it's just the characters that are repeated over and over again. Because Idon't even know history myself,right? Just say what is there as long as it looks like it is there"
"Next time watching the movie once is enough. The3-4 times you look at that Mat Kilau,it's really a shot to your brain, even yourbrother's brother is dizzy, BN is falling, andyou're getting dizzy"
"And to those who use mat kilau movie as a good example, yall should really learn history with books, not"
"All those tiktok videos that are funny mention the movie Mat Kilau. Not the character, but the movie. Now tell me that moviewasn't an effective propaganda piece. PN should give Syamsul Yusuf some sort of"
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
"I remember there was a movie reviewer who discussed the Malaysian demographics affecting the collection of movies. At that time, people were talking about RM 30 million as the most they could get if you take into account the audience factor on Earth. Hopefully MatKilau's story will attract anon-Earthly audience"
just pure arrogance Mat Kilau movie had cemented into the mainstream. Many Malays now feel comfortable showing theirs
I just saw Dahmer andI'm feeling nauseous..it's not yet Eid gain andit's a movie. Idon't see the Mat Kilau
"Fakeaccount? Check back, I have this account since when. X main r fake2. The court case was not settled because my boss wanted to prove that he was guilty.That's it. Very jealous of people. How is our nation going toprogress? Itdoesn't look like a shelf. Idon't feel the spicy sarcasm in the movie. Thick"

"2. Since only Whites are referred with""Sir"" which means""Mister"" by most of malays nowadays, itdoesn't Mat Kilaur to say that Mat Kilau movie is totally nothing more than a useless history documentation in cinemas. They should refer to them as""mister""(encik), no more""sir"""

It's not political propaganda i hate mat kilau film also because the quality as a movie i grow up watching bllywood and tllywood every friday n sunday most of the time villain is muslim wedon't condemnit's as racist it just a movie even do we know Muslim in India is
Me and my girls watched Mat Kilau for the first few minutes and then we changed it to something else. Not because the movie was bad.. but those kids getting shot was just too
"All the noise about Mat Kilau, sis, I want to share it. Just watch it once,it's ok if you want to repeat it. This movie reminds me of special moves + hypocrisy hmm eeeiiI'm not good at reviewing movies"
Idon't understand why some Malays are unable to understand Mat Kilau movie deeply. Some of them believed we should againts opposition nowadays but infact we should unite againts the Malay government that we have now This is a clear and accurate description down to the hole
Mat Kilau on Netflix seems like a different experience compared to watching in theater. Watching it in theater the speaker is so loud and loud and loud but in netflix it feels like a normal sound
"That's syamsul yusof, why did he get the script, the movie became a commercial success because of the legendary name, if itwasn't for Mat Kilau, already"
"Eee, how is tiber siott.. how did he turn to malay.. when did he argue about the history of malay people.. he just commented about the movie instead of the Mat Kilau itself.. pleasedon't embarrass yourself here.. you really lack on reading comprehension.. a lot of reading"
Okay but what type of dialogue that you guys expect for Mat Kilau huh i dont understand this folks and i saw some that waiting for a big plotwhat??? Comeon its a historical movie.... if you want to watch it then watch it if you are not interested then
I'm really lazy to watch the power comment about the Mat Kilau movie. Idon't even know what you expect in the story
"Those who have watched mat kilau on Netflix, then there are those who are not satisfied, whydon't you be like that.. if you want to be satisfied, watch the movie..that's the right feeling, watch mat kilau..I've watched it 4 times already I want to see it again but later"
"It's true what they said in the movie Mat Kilau, you can thinkit's just a story to entertain but take it so seriously that every day you want"
5 minutes early... Mat Kilau..*sound effect Mat Kilau like you see in Dragon Ball..* change another movie
"I'm ok with the movie Mat Kilau, only if the opponents act like KL Gangster. Just make it normal. But because the market here likes rival stories, the heavy biography genre is how well it sells"
"Hahaha, it seems that after watching the movie, youdidn't read the real history of Mat Kilau. So please shut up. Because the more you sound the more you appear to be one of the people who failed the history subject first.*I've seen the movie andit's still a failure"
"Watch the movie PUTERI GUNUNG LEDANG. big gap from Mat Kilau. The type of images, the style of conversation, the way the story is told... the difference.. 2004 vs 2022, the difference between the 2004 film and the 5"
Mat Kilau as a movie yes But the real history of the man is not an insult MalayCulture=/Malay
As history movie loverI'm approved Mat Kilau. Sis
"Just watching Mat Kilau. Very cool movie, it is easy to understand and talk about. Definitely not for starbucks folks, but for teh tarik drinkers this is some topic and maybe a start to you know, way to move forward. We are too comfortable to appreciate it"
"It's good to make a trap in the forest, suddenly the British can come out recklessly like that. I feel angry when I watch Mat Kilau movies"
He clearly said that the movie is fiction and inspired by Mat Kilau. What kind of history is it if from start to finish you fight by talking without looking at the camera
"It's like Netflix has a Mat Kilau story. If youdon't like it, watch another movie.What's yourIP?"
What do you do when it feels like nothing else can be watched onNetflix? Not Mat Kilau movie.
"whydon't the people who judge the Mat Kilau movie really relax, you tell the story of a bored omputih, youdon't want to judge 14 days and 14 nights. This story has been going on for a long time, why are you upagain? triggered because of many support and"
"I just saw the Mat Kilau before I think the movie is ok. A movie about Malay history,right? History is like that, it can be changed at will. What you want to show is"
"The feeling of watching Mat Kilau at the cinema is different if you compare it to Netflix. At the movie, I feel likeit's not bad. When I look back on Netflix, it feels like a movie trash"
"Even watching Netflix is paid, but in Netflix there is not only Mat Kilau, there are many other movies.. if youdon't want to watch, you can watch other movies, ifit's a legitimate movie, we only pay to watch that story.. so the tweeter said watch I understand the meaning of Netflix free"
"He's like you are a fan of Thor movies.I'm a fan of Mat Kilau stories. When a lot of people curse on Twitter aboutThor's story, do you getangry?""Thor is the worst movieI've even seen.."" like that. Like what they did to Mat Kilau. And not for a full explanation.I'm more interested in the story line"
"I'm angry. Because I think the story of Thor Thunder& Love is not the best, I will not curse on Twitter. But, whenit's a Malay story.. itdoesn't Mat Kilau. You will judge..it's not fair,right? Judge is the worst movie. Butdon't even explain"
"The problem is correct. Ifit's a hollywood story, release the same scene as in the Mat Kilau. This tribe does not want to condemn. Whenit's a Malay movie, you quickly tweet all the things youdon't like, andyou're happy to say that Malayscan't be touched, soyou're weak because you want to insult Malays."
"Repeat after me..""MAT KILAU IS NOT A HISTORY MOVIE."
"Who is interested in watching Mat Kilau movie,don't force people who are not interested to be interested. Those who are not interested in watching Mat Kilau,don't force interested people not to be interested.That's just a story for me. Designed and created for film. Some like it, somedon't like it."
"At first, Ididn't see the Mat Kilau at GSC,it's strange why the language is not right, but when you think about the logic of the spa language, you still want to use it for movies, you want to use b. baku,it's illegal for people to understand,right? I want to read the subs, I want to feel the scenes again.. I just got it.. Last, if you want to make a whole movie, use that language"
Gosh!! Ican't stand it... I feel nauseous and continue to breastfeed my child while watching a movie
"Wedon't condemn Mat Kilau films for nothing, but for the people in the industry to improve their products because we want to make high quality films which our neighbors Thailand and Indonesia have been doing for the past15-20 years. Please learn,won'tyou?"
It's a good feeling to watch a Mat Kilau movie with another netflix.That's why a lot of people sayit's not the best when watching netflix Mat Kilau movies
"The best thing iswhat's bad, even ifit's bad, at least this Mat Kilau can come to teaching, thenit's easy for students to understand history instead of reading and memorizing from textbooks. Those who feel bad go make movies"
"Idon't know. Mat Kilau stays9/10. One of the best movies that has been brilliant for me. With the actors& sentences that were thrown all A+& hit my soul. Other people want to curse, curse. ButDon't""Insult"""
I want to curse the movie Mat Kilau.Don't curse Beto Kusyairy. I fought until the end
Idon't want to defend and condemn more fictional movies whose characters are just coincidences with history. Fictional. Rekaan. We should not even care if Mat Kilau is wearing a superman shirt riding a dinosaur against the British while singing a song
"Match the emotional hang name lol. That day, Zhaf cursed the yellow girl, you said it was her right as aticket-paying audience to comment on the movie,what's the point of criticizing it, she insulted me even more.I'm criticizing and getting criticized by Mat Kilau fans. Hypocrite"
"It's fun to curse the movie Mat Kilau.I'm quite happy that someone is willing to make a movie about a historical figure, not an influencer, a drug kingpin who speaks Malay plates, a rich family who wants to pay for it, a slapstick comedy that has no direction"
"matkilau's story(not themovie) is inspirational andshould've been done right in the movie, bcs i am not feeling the malay propaganda in this"
"because I already know the story line& the sound at my house is not as good as in the movie. I will never watch a movie that Ididn't understand the first time. I watched it again just once. I thinkit's best because I already know the storyline& I like it because I understand it, butit's upside down, peopledon't"
Why are the gangs of gangs who are angry about Mat Kilau beingcriticized? Are you the one who benefits from this movie or do you feel that the dignity of your nation and country is beingchallenged? Criticism This can be used as a step to further improve the level of our film industry. We already know there is potential
"This Mat Kilau story can be a type of investigative film. Detective movie. Find out who is the defector of Malay officials. At the end, Mat Kilau seems to have sacrificed himself forPahang's victory, but the final scene shows him living in the forest. The black shirt with the raspy voice is there, allthat's left is the mask..."
"Hahaha every month he subscribes not just to watch one story, not Mat Kilau but the movie on Netflix. Idon't even have netflix free. But when you think about it, people want to wait for Netflix because they want to chill and save money"
"Have your own opinion.. about this Mat Kilau.. at least there is anger towards the colonialists..that's good enough.. sometimes these tribes are one thing more than foreign movies.. littered with stories about movies.. for me, Malaysians rarely do factual stories.. want to ask to read history, kaji. jauh.. read a novel"
"Why do many people say MatKilau's story isbad/give a badrating?That's why before this, why can the movieexplode?"
I've seen Mat Kilau on netflix already. SyamsulYusuf's typical action movie.I'm so bored that Idon't feel like commenting.
"I see the best. Your mind is narrow to make a comparison with Hollywood,it's really different, people with a budget of ten million. Matt kilau is a movie about history, where can you turn it away like an action orsci-fi movie, you expect"
"Sept 18, 2022- Ihaven't seen Mat Kilau yet, no movies& no Netflix. Anyone who has seen it, understands that it is a movie, not the History Channel. So there is a little adjustment, so chill.. just enjoy it"
"Haven't watched Mat Kilau. Had a chance to see the Air Force.It's not the kind of diligent to watch movies actually, but people invite us onz. Usually had time to sleep in there But watching AirForce that day, Ididn't even feel sleepy. Luck"
"Its an adaptation based on what actually happened, of course some modifications were made. The two scenes practically made the whole movie bro. Mat kilau is a real figure and how he was depicted fits his description in history, whether you like it or not"
Remember we have moved on from Mat Kilau when the movie release near the cinema. Nowwe're all back to square one
"That day someone asked for an opinion on which Mat Kilau with Air Force is the best. I said it, air force.. He should have started a long description that is Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau,it's the best blah blah blah Duh, I just like watching movies..It's rare to judge from the cinematography, background music, camera, etc."
"It's not like that.Don't judge people like that. For me, I feel crazy and strange when I read the replies in this thread that are all about Mat Kilau.. Just enjoy it, just watch the movie"
"no body love british or hating mat kilau himself, we know ckp psl quality movie n tk fhm why ppl bashing like become apostate if ckp this movie is normal, over betul dh become level ifrajnikanth's character dies on stage kna"
"Maybe for bro this movie is a popcorn movie. But maybe there are a few who take it as knowledge. Because there are people who start to discover the original story of psl heroes mat kilau and other heroes. Ok what..""I mean a few, you know. Not"
"Idon't know why you want to defend the Mat Kilau movie so much, the quality is not equal, the standard of SY has that movie, he is good at trying new things& has a strong influence in commercial but the movie does not depict the real atmosphere of Mat Kilau"
"Yes correct. But please make the story of the prophet and make it a historical fiction movie.That's what Idon't agree with. Ni Kisah mat kilauBeb: Even thoughit's big,it's not the same. But there is also input,right: psl silat psl religion psl war with colonialists. So we take it as good input"
Can you imagine that the sacrifice that they do. At the end of the movie you can see most of the villagers come to help Mat Kilau. It does really happen. Guerrilla war as it was called. Pleasedon't mock it if you never appreciate the history. I feel sad
Good comment. Syamsul has to read the negative comments that build up his movie for his own good. MatKilau's success now is due to other factors. The quality of this kind of film does not guarantee the success of his films in the future. He got it
"It may not be suitable for somepeople's expectations, we watch the movie for various purposes. The first time we saw Mat Kilau, the national hero, while watching the touching story of how our ancestors were killed at will. The 2nd time bring the children to get to know Mat"
"It's true, it really is way behind compared to braveheart or any other historical western movie. But its a step forward from our past. From rempit movies to hantu kak limah etc, now we are making much better quality movies that portray our local figures as"
"hopefullythere'd be more proper adaptations of our local heroes, but maybe the next ones will be for other filmmakers to give them justice. sad really, cuz i really love the story of mat kilau as a kid. but then to see him being used as a propa movie this way kinda breaks me"
bcs i feel like the patriotism in me is woken up by watching mat kilau bcs its been years since the last time i watched movies like that
"Mat Kilau is 5 stars in terms of marketing,that's why it costs 100 million. I likeBeto's acting in this movie. His eyes are expensive"
"For me,it's the best gilaa movie air force, I feel like your quote should be comparable to Mat Kilau, you know, becauseit's cheap"
"I started reading about the history of the Titanic because I just watched the movie Titanic.It's the same after people look at Mat Kilau. At that time, many people were interested in looking back at people to do research on Mat Kilau and read it"
"My8-year-old stepdaughter has an interest in Mat Kilau. He was really excited when he saw the movie Mat Kilau that day. Until now, he is still crazy about Mat Kilau. From MatKilau's story, he found many other histories.I'm tired"
"It's like me in a scene like that Hindustan movie, that is in one of these scenes where Matt puts a dagger on the neck of Captain Syers.. whispers his name and then the music score comes out."
"That's right, after that you can cite Najib for corruption without joining the struggle, why does everything have to bepoliticized? People just watch the movie, theydon't want to watch trashy political stories, they want political talk, wait for the pru, they want to insult the Mat Kilau movie just to insult the political party"
Idon't know ifI'm not interested in history or ifit's the Mat Kilau movie
"Hahah, I said this Mat Kilau was inspired by the movie wong feihung because the sound effect is like Chinese martial art"
The raid is an Indonesian film.. the director of captain america only admitted that his fighting scene was inspired by the raid.. even samuel l jackson said that the raid was his all time favorite movie.. this is a Mat Kilau finish you set with the raid
"Special Moves series PASCAL Police Evo Mat Kilau Everyone has their own class Maybe wedon't know how many children of Watan whose exposure topolice/soldiers/heroes came from this movie For me, this is more important than debating the cinematography issue"
"Cany'all please STFU about reviewing MatKilau? If you like it, great. If youdon't,it's alright. Everyone has their own taste when watching movies or TV shows. But ify'all make shit up just to fight over a MOVIE, go fuck yourself and touch some grass"
"Actually, I want to rate the Mat Kilau low because I can yawn throughout the story. It rarely happens. But because people buy movie tickets, so I end up rate is high, sayingit's good but not the best"
"I hope to be able to see MatKilau's character live, what kind of personality he has. his conversational style. what I understand is only philosophy. The script of the movie and the character of Mat Kilau is not"
"When Mat Kilau comes out on neflix, movie critics come out and comment like this, Air Forcehasn't yet had a story on neflix, ghisau is turned away by the soldiers who comment later. Guys, to produce a movie requires mental and physical sacrifice from each member"
"It's ok,I'll look at this Mat Kilau story. What are you so fussyabout? But for meit's not a big impact to have a movie"
"Have you ever seen the IPstory? How is he against 10people? But those who attack him are not all at once. Just like this Mat Kilau story.It's called a story. If you want to be logical, you just read history. No need to look"
"Mat Kilau is a movie. But netizens who are so sarcasticcan't be criticized. There are critics like it should depict101% of history, whichdoesn't make sense because the movie is made to appeal to the most segment"
"Already watched Mat Kilau. How tosay? I can only give around 1 out of 5 stars. There are so many weaknesses. If youdon't want to get ready to relax, fill in the space or give it to the kids,that's it. But not recommended at all for actionmovies/dramas& history lovers. I like action genre and history"
"Malay klu in the chat section condemned person no. 1. Hg tgk movie not documentary. He has already made a disclaimer. He has a movie he likes.It's not based on the true story of the last two blackhawkdowns, the westdidn't win apo. Suh barat has a hero to make a new Mat Kilau comparable to your taste"
not surprised to see mat kilau getting low ratings from people.i've said it before that the pacing was so off and the dialogue sounds pretentious in every way. you can make apatriotic/historical movie without it being as messy as it is
"I always tell people whohaven't seen Mat Kilau, if you want to see the film version of Perhimpunan Agong UMNO... Watch the film.It's a bad movie. The positive from the movie, Beto"
"true! many discussions in terms of expanding knowledge in history this what historical movies should be, endless discussion. Independence does not happen without discussions. mat kilau is more like promoting culture w history but history is more"
"Those whodon't like watching Mat Kilau movies are welcome..It's up to each other... ButI'm ready to stamp people who like to watch that story as""lowIQ""that's more than enough..... Lek2dahlewâ€¦"
Is the Mat Kilau moviegood?It's a movie. Has a specific appeal. Triggers some specific feelings.Doesn't really leave a lasting impression. Not the actors norcrew's fault. The producer and director just have a specific mission. Was never meant to be
"Personally, I reallydon't like the movie directed byYusoff's son becauseI've seen it once on TV, Munafik. Hahahaha so when this Mat Kilau comes out,I'm skeptical when people sayit's crazy. The timeline is full of words,it's not the best whenit's on Netflix. Fortunately, Ididn't run out of money"
I just feel like watching a movie
"Idon't like people on Twitter who""after 10 minutes open the Mat Kilau near netflix, it closesimmediately"" Idon't know what is your intention to say that. Then add on,""it's suitable forMalays"" Haah,you're really distracted watching all the movies. The story is old, people are hyped"
"Finally got to watch Mat Kilau via netflix. Well, I must say good movie for a Malay historical genre n of coz the star studded cast.Didn't know tis Mat Kilau is"
"After watching the scene against Mat Kilau, I conclude that only deep people can accept the story from this alarming POV. I just want to relax and watch more movies"
Up back MatKilau's tweet since Netflix came out. You can enter the history of this movie. The success
What's the point of arguing about Mat Kilau for months without end.You're not the one who turned into a stunt instead of fattah amin fighting in that movie
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film. From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot. What do youget? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive, I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing.That's why he brought in the premiere"
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film. From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot. What do youget? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive, I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing.That's why during the premiere he was transported into the movie"
"Just need to add on how it is. The note that was given to the villagers for taxation, ends with""God save thequeen"". During 1892""mat kilau moviesetting"" the ruler of England was King George V. Small details MatKilaur's"
"Can withstand the bad review of Mat Kilau. Ididn't see it. Shuk saw yesterday. But I came out of the room and asked him what movie he was watching because I heard howling screams and felt nervous. I was like""What movie isthat? It sounds like chaos. I have to scream even if I want to talk"
"The queen died between Aug. 31 and Sept. 16, two very important dates for Malaysian nationalism, in a country still debating its independence narrative and colonial history. Just recently, ananti-British colonial era movie'MatKilau' made over 100m ringgit in the"
"It's okay, I looked at the Mat Kilau, the empty one turned away from history.. the movie critics turned away,what's the Mat Kilaur. Just enjoy it. Woke indeterminate"
"They are using MatKilau's name for the movie,he's the main character, so I think the least they could do is add in a little bit of history to show thathe's""MatKilau"".I'm not talking about100% history, but at least I think there should be a distinctive scene based on"
"Movie Mat Mat Kilau is easy to understand and digest. Direct to the point.. I think the presentation is important.. if you want to understand this history you have to be relaxed. if you are serious, people will run away and not want to see"
"Syamsul Yusofdoesn't even want to make a good movie. But he wants to make a movie that exploits this theme. Gangsterism(KLGangster), Witchcraft& Dark Arts(Hypocrisy), Malay history(Mat"
"Done watching mat glitter on netflix. Why netflix because there is a small child, it is not suitable to take to the cinema. Mat Kilaureview: Everything is ok, the story line(must be based on a true storyright), the color of the movie is ok. But, there are some"
"Idon't even think I want to look at it. I know enough about his history, even in that movie he worked out a little bit to become that tall. Do you want to be distracted by the movie, the criticcan't be criticized,it's you who are distracted, that syamsul is eating a delicious steak"
"yes, I know that some will be like'mat kilau, okay what, at leastit's different from other movies, which are fun stories about love or gangstersetc' yes, that is undeniable but all this critic& review means that there is more room for films Malaysia to"
"what's the problem with this Mat Kilaustory? Malaysians are condemned to work. You also condemn the air force story. you just make the movie. Idon't like it,it's okay, Idon't care. sit still"
"; There are so many people condemning the Mat Kilau movie that they just watched on Netflix that they feel like they have a low IQ level. Lol,you're confused, you have a high iq, you can go on the road with your opinion. Aachah2 turned away"
"Tgk Mat Kilau reminds me of RRR... the format is the same... intensity, background music, action are all the best, only the shaking camera part is a bit lacking... But still a"
I'll look at that Mat Kilau later. I feel like I want to watch an English movie but Idon't know how
Now why do you have to rely on Zhaf to have a movie commenteh? Idon't know when he trashed all the movies on your thumbnail for clickbait. Not creative. And Mat Kilau is directed by Syamsul Yusuf. It can be said that this story is just a popcorn movie. Not atop-tier kinda
"Not a fan of Mat Kilau but at least I have something to watch on netflix with my parents. Instead of English movie with'awkwardscene' or never ending Malay ghost story, rempit movie,"
Am i the only one whowasn't really impressed with
"After watching the Mat Kilau movie. The camera is not relaxing. Left right front back. Part opponent to jetty to tgh bersilat to. X relax eh. Time to chat with a lot of people, change the shot every 2 seconds. Eye pain, loss of focus. Suddenly the drone shot, went back in for a close shot"
"instead of watching Mat Kilau, you should watch Paloh, a good pseudo historical movie by adman salleh. although the editing was quite poor Idon't mind as long as the actors were paid well"
"Ni citer Mat Kilau or the documentary History of the school syllabus,"
"Same concept as Marvel. Does the physics theory in Marvel make everyone100% explorephysics? But people talk about it. Same as this I never saw people discussing about mat kilau on social media beside textbook history. After this movie, people talk about Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau"
Fil has been feeling a bit under a weather today and asked me to record mat kilau on netflix he didnt want to miss our movie nite ok postpone
"Too many critics on Mat Kilau But honestly, Idon't thinkit's a very bad movie, it can be a bonus to feel proud with enthusiasm. But air force srsly his vibes are different. 2 times aq usha and both aq nangeh.I've tried it many times but I stillcan't feel it"
"When talking about Mat Kilau, people must want to know forexample:-Who is the MatKilau?-How is hislife?-Who is histeacher? The best example of Merong Mahawangsa movie. Character building is solid. Just technology, budget, not suitable&Merong's history is much more"
I saw mat kilau on netflix with the same reaction in the movie that I watched about 5 times.. hahaha Idon't understand the people who make the movie tell me about the story of mat kilau.. hahaha sian eh
"if you want to watch Malay movies related to history, watch puteri gunung ledang, 29 februari and lieutenant adnan. pleasedon't waste your time on mat kilau."
"I'm not thatwell-versed in story telling butit's not wrong to be critical because I love this kind of movies being made more into our art industry,it's more about giving a good message, like citing mat kilau of course at least The plotlineisn't too much"
but if anyone wants to make a badang story please cast fattah amin his action scene in mat kilau movie is
"None of MatKilau's history is available. Mat kilau is a catfish for tgk people. Its more of a movie to make Malays realize'this is ur land, dont chicken out and defend it like what our forefathers did for"
"""it's not the best to quote this, it sounds likehe'sover"" my bro to mat kilau"
"""it's not the best to quote this, it sounds likehe'sover"" my bro to mat kilau"
"Today the movie Mat Kilau is out on Netflix.I'm sorry, am I the only one who thinks this story isoverrated? I like Puteri Gunung Ledang again. At the beginning of the Mat Kilau movies, I started asking, was there an inner hood in the olddays?"
mama as a history teacher said something wrong w mat kilau the
"the biggest mistake coming from the most visible film was the fact that NO ONE used the Pahang accent throughout the whole movie, especially when it was set at Jerantut like come on"
I hope youdon't lose the luster like you do in brsilat. But watching air force the movie feels the sacrifice of our army for the sake of the country. The sense of sacrifice that we hope is our own is not always possible... Cita is a lot of dead characters
"Air Force, the movie is really hyped,it's like a Mat Kilau finish. Jlan Cita is the best. X clichÃ©, fighting hard.. fighting hard. The path of ambition is crazy. It feels like the sacrifice of a military hero.. There are only one or two characters that stand out. Wlupn core cita psai Rock ngn"
"I want to ask a little, the one who is interested in the Mat Kilau movie reference,don't you study History atschool? After watching the movie, will you know about Mat Kilau and the battle againstoppressors? If this is the case, just abolish the History subject and replace it with a subject"
"Lps mat kilau, many people spread hate towards british for colonizing malaysia and scooping up all theearth's produce. But.. How boujapan? Is it because the movie""embun""doesn't top like a MatKilau? In conclusion wecan't erase history but why bother until you want to play racist"
"The one who said that is gobloq. Ignore it. A lot of people watch Mat Kilau because this is one of the filmmakers' efforts to build a movie about history after a long time. The effort is pretty good. We also study hero Mat Kilau in school. Therefore, many dtg"
"I'm not interested in the Mat Kilau movie, but imagine how he felt when he saw the government of the state pouring its own land in the direction of flying the flag athalf-mast for three days."
