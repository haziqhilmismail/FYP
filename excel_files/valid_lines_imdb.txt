This is literally the worst film from the $T$, his previous films were watchable and enjoyable.
Director
Negative
I decided to give it a go and try watching this movie with my family... and i just don' t understand why people making a fuss about this movie... first of all $T$ can do better... should hire someone who is actually good in doing scriptwriting... Shamsul Yusuf should just stick to directing... you don' t need to show that you can do everything but the outcome is like those tv malay drama series....... the transition between scenes is just mediocre... its like you watching a snippet of scenes and end up gluing it together... there is no continuity on the entire movie.... jumping all over here and there.... The shaky camera works should be less.. you should learn by watching from the experts like steven spielberg' s" private ryan" or any from paul.

camera works
Negative
Greengrass films... oh and the kicking and puching sound during the martial arts silat sequence should be more realistic... not some recycle sound from your old KL gangster film.... lousy $T$. Should hire a proper sound designer and a good foley artist.... oh and the set designer should do more proper study on the surroundings... for example there is a scene where the landscape is showing the people doing the.
sound
Negative
The $T$ is very straightforward and thin, without much depth.
storyline
Neutral
It is about the exploitation of British colonisers, and how the people stand up to fight for their land. The $T$ is weak.
pacing
Negative
It moves too fast from one scene to another( jumping scenes), making the story hard to breathe or digest at times. There are plenty of $T$.
action scenes
Neutral
Fighting with the soldiers and the same" villain" again and again, making the $T$ flat.
actions
Negative
However, it' s just made fights for the sake of fighting! Besides, the $T$ movement is just too shaky that I give up on the action scenes, or rather feel uncomfy towards the action scenes( headache and dizzy).
camera
Negative
It' s alright to have" shaky camera" technique at times, like some Hollywood movies, BUT NOT overdone throughout the entire movie from the beginning to the end. The $T$ is seriously weak.
character development

The $T$ and sentimental value is just NOT there enough to touch anyone.

Maybe I was wrong, by the way. Malaysian films like Ola Bola, Sepet, movies of P. Ramlee etc, give me hope and excitement, on the other hand, this film $T$ weird and kind of out of place.
feels
Negative
The $T$ is pretty good actually, but when it comes to the message and the target audiences, the director needs to consider himself to unite the nation. Mat Kilau: Kebangkitan Pahlawan is surely a milestone for local creators, but I hope I could watch some more creative and cheerful films to deal with the problemata.

This $T$ is shallow, peppered with preachy scripts and cliches. It needs a better writer... Character building is almost non- existent.

Character building
Negative
This was done over and over againThis makes the $T$ one dimensional and they wasted such a good talent on this.
protagonist
Negative
Some of the minor $T$ have better development than the protagonist. It needs breathing room... Some of the scenes jump around too fast, it seems as though they were rushing it in the editing room.

acting
Negative
Childish $T$ on antagonist.
narrative
Negative
$T$ inaccurate doesnt mean the story have to be unrealistic. Though response from the local shows that malaysian simply judge local film by fighting act and cast presentation. Indonesian' s Rudie Habibie for example does spent their plot on fighting and choreography.
Historically
Negative
But $T$ arc, less fighting, less screaming, less preaching. Another collection of trash from the Yusuf' s.
good character
Positive
The thing about $T$ is he' s a visionary directory, talented but he clearly needs to focus more on the writing department or just get someone who' s better at this. Mat Kilau has its moment that you can truely feels its sheer epic scale and heightened your spirit of nationalism.
Syamsul
Negative
The $T$ were fairly good and really embodied the greatness of Silat.
fight sequences
Positive
To summarize, $T$ is fast, action packed and straightforward formulaic biography that able to cater most Malaysians taste. Now the writing... The script is just lackluster and have Syamsul' s trademark all over it.
Mat Kilau

script
Negative
But the gripe of having this kind of script is that it makes the $T$ seems unnatural and very one dimensional. The pacing problem.
character
Negative
This is likely a $T$ issue than editing. Mat Kilau, the titular role is very one dimensional and there isn' t any interesting arcs to this character even though Adi Putra nails the character well enough.

Mat Kilau

Even the character played by Beto Kusyairi has more depth to it. Some $T$ and minor characters are hugely underdeveloped that they suddenly appeared near the end of the film.

quality
Negative
The $T$ was incredible and delivered a powerful performance in this film, but the rest was a colossal waste of potential.
cast
Positive
If the director had not found the right cast in the first place, this film would have been a flop. The $T$ is basic.
script
Negative
The Malay $T$ is less accurate than it was in the 1980s.

acting
Negative
I cant stand it at allThe $T$ is good; I wouldn' t call it bad. It takes the whole immersion away from this movie with the Sikhs' actors as British soldiers.
story
Positive
It does not have very much $T$ to it. If this is the level of quality that local people like and get excited about, Malaysia' s film industry will continue to regress. And all the fuss and chaos from a few months ago is just too much.
depth
Negative
Even as it is not $T$, the least it can have is depth, which it doesn' t. The story is pretty weak.
historically accurate

They wanted to capture an original $T$, but it turns your stomach when you watch it. I forced myself to watch it( just to see what was the fuss about), and it was a complete waste of my time.
camera action
Negative
The $T$ needs to be improved again, what I see in this movie is that there is no continuity from scene to scene, it' s like there is nothing to do between the scenes.
storyline
Negative
Secondly, the main hero $T$, Mat Kilau, has no backstory and character development and that needs to be improved.

Infusing overtones of racism, bigotry, Malay Nationalism and Islamic virtue signal calling in it' s $T$, this movie did not represent or tell the true intellectual depth of the malays and malayans at the said events in time.
script

A lot of the time in this movie, they preach so much about islamic teachings but not about the $T$ that is ingrained into the culture.

This movie didn' t do justice to the great Malay warrior Mat Kilau in the struggle to fight off British colonial aggression. The $T$ was bad.

They could hire great British actors but chose to use really bad' English' $T$ whose acting skill are of low standard.

However, $T$ in this film are portrayed as stupid and short- sighted.
British

THE $T$ IIFrom the very beginning to the very end the many characters talked about Malay ketuanan, Islam, the evil of infidel British and sovereignty of Tanah Melayu.

Bad $T$, a so so fight sequence with lots of shaky camera, terrible scripts and not a good actings from the actors and actresses.

I love the genre, i love martial arts movies, love anything to do with no nonsense straight to the point kick ass movie, like similar the Raid, Berandal etc... however, i feel that this movie reached the highest returns for a malay movie only due to the theme of the patriotism which it tried to depict... especially when the country is grappling with so many political issues and hence the need to have such movie... In a way, it did touched me sentimentally, however it was overly used that it became too cheesy... the $T$ are good but they could be compensated with much better dialogues, story line and better cinematography especially the fighting scenes.. the worst for me was the fighting scenes... the cameras were shaking and why the need to put the soundtrack throughout the fighting scenes plus the sounds of the punches or kicking or hitting felt these were done back in the 80s with lesser technology.... potrayal of silat as a martial art could be much better with better cinematography or choreography... i am sure the director could have done better as i thoroughly enjoyed his KL gangster movies but maybe for some reasons he was not able to emulate the same for this.

Too much expectation from others, almost sold out everywhere where I live. The $T$ were so fast that I couldn' t keep up with the tempo and they answered in less than a second.
characters ' lines
Negative
And also the $T$, especially at around 15 minute when the British talk, it change like every 2- 3 second when they talking, it hurt my eye.
visual transition
Negative
The $T$ of the main cast was terrible, it didn' t feel like the main actors of the main cast were giving in that much effort and heart, they acted too melodramatic.
acting
Negative
The $T$ of the villains was outright corny and garbage that it' s laughable especially the British commander character.

The minor characters either acted very melodramatic or not even trying with their performances. The $T$ of this film was awful, all the characters.

villains ' lines
Negative
There was no development in the main character. The characters never felt like actual humans due to the corny and very melodramatic lines and acting except Toga the actor played him quite well despite the melodramatic lines. The $T$ was dreadful, and the camera shots of the non- action scenes were generic and uninteresting.
cinematography

The $T$ of the action scenes was very shaky and messy and it was confusing sometimes. The editing was very choppy and muddled.

The movie also had one of the best ensemble $T$ ever with a lot of A- list actor such as from main character( Adi Putra, Fattah Amin and Beto Kusyairy) to side character( Namron, Dato Jalaluddin Hassan and Wan Hanafi Su). Still, there is a plenty of flaws that can be improvised.

script
Negative
A dramatisation of true historical events that intrigued the crowd that it intended to& more. The $T$ is crazy, you move from one scene to another keeping the viewers engaged. While the performance from the protagonists are amazing, it was dragged down by the stark contrast of the weak performance by one of the main antagonists, Captain Syers. The dialogues ranges from amazing& inspirational to repetitive& monotonous.

POSITIVES: + It has a decent cinematography overall. + The action scenes displaying the indigenous martial arts Silat was also good and entertaining. + High production value. + The original soundtracks are okay.. NEGATIVES. There were some interesting $T$ that I feel were done poorly such as Kilau' s wisdom in leading the Malay uprising, Wahid' s anger and avenging his wife, Awang' s redemption arc after his failed plan cost some lives.
storylines
Negative
It could have shown a $T$ development.
good character
Positive
The main thing i love about the $T$ in the movie is that there are many utterance in the name of Allah and the right use of Wisdom from the Quran and the Sunnah, i just love it and it was respectfully used in a proper way and also there are many real life advice that is applicable to our life.

dialogues
Negative
$T$ was inconsistent throughout and the ambient light was seen so fake that even the glare and flickering seemed to be operated by someone who lacked experience.
Lighting
Negative
The $T$ was acceptable but the camera movements were just horrid.
choreography
Neutral

It explains the lack of $T$ by the film director. Production Design: I must say that the production design of this film was poor, very poor indeed.

A mediocre work by the $T$. Make up on characters were like they were all going for a wedding.

The $T$ applied were not right for the film and lighting.
colour tones
Negative
Seriously, his $T$ never made any sense in the plot. I wouldn' t want to say much of the other characters but they were portrayed accordingly by accomplished actors such as Rahim Razali and Jalaluddin Hassan. Post Production: The film lacked creativity in terms of edits.
character
Negative
First and foremost, the $T$ was off as it didn' t give a look and feel of that era but again, tones of colour grading is usually the director' s choice. Scenes looked like they were slashed here and there and then glued up together to create a sequence.
grading
Negative
The slow- mo effect was used frequently for the same type action and it became boring quickly. $T$ were mediocre.
Visual effects
Negative
The $T$ largely sounded like compositions from Hans Zimmer, John Williams or David Arnold.
music score
Positive
Even the silat sequences was backed with a westernised orchestral music. The $T$ was just mismatched as though it sounded like a modern ninja film but with a 1700s backdrop.
sound design
Negative
The beautifully prepared $T$ being wasted over bad cinematography.

CinematographyThe quality of $T$ is very impressive, as good as a Hollywood production. Nevertheless, the deliberate" jerking" of fight scenes was rather off putting.
