"This is literally the worst film from the Director , his previous films were watchable and enjoyable . "
This one fails so badly till you legit have to force yourself to watch till the end . 
"Could ' ve improved a lot of things but they ' ve decided to leave it that day ! Overall watch at your own risk , skip this if you want to . "
"I decided to give it a go and try watching this movie with my family . . . and i just don ' t understand why people making a fuss about this movie . . . first of all screenwriting can do better . . . should hire someone who is actually good in doing scriptwriting . . . Shamsul Yusuf should just stick to directing . . . you don ' t need to show that you can do everything but the outcome is like those tv malay drama series . . . . . . . the transition between scenes is just mediocre . . . its like you watching a snippet of scenes and end up gluing it together . . . there is no continuity on the entire movie . . . . jumping all over here and there . . . . The shaky camera works should be less . . you should learn by watching from the experts like steven spielberg ' s "" private ryan "" or any from paul . "
Greengrass films . . . oh and the kicking and puching sound during the martial arts silat sequence should be more realistic . . . not some recycle sound from your old KL gangster film . . . . lousy sound . Should hire a proper sound designer and a good foley artist . . . . oh and the set designer should do more proper study on the surroundings . . . for example there is a scene where the landscape is showing the people doing the . 
"Gold panning and it shows the tent is all so clean and so white . . . . bear in mind that scenes is at a gold mining area with all the muds etc but yet the tent is so clean . . . . and even the villagers costume as well as the Mat kilau crew is using a well clean , iron straight from the boutique quality . . . . . does not feel that the villagers are living in poverty . . . . . the ending scene is like you suddenly realize that you are running out of money and just simply cut short the film . . there is no proper ending/ summary to this film . . . . even the character of Captain Syers by Geoff Andre Feyaerts during the final retreat scene is not properly develop . . . should develop showing the frustration / or the vengeance feeling towards the rebels and showing his vows to come again if there is any plan to do a sequel . . . . . . . . . i left the cinema with WTF ! ! ! "
Why people say it is an awesome movie . . . i have seen better malay films . . . . . . if there is a sequel shamsul yusof should and . studio kembara should do more proper study and not some so so film like this . 
"The storyline is very straightforward and thin , without much depth . "
"It is about the exploitation of British colonisers , and how the people stand up to fight for their land . The pacing is weak . "
"It moves too fast from one scene to another ( jumping scenes ) , making the story hard to breathe or digest at times . There are plenty of action scenes . "
"BUT they are mostly "" repetitive "" , e . g . "
"Fighting with the soldiers and the same "" villain "" again and again , making the actions flat . "
"Perhaps a real super - villain shall be saved for the very END , so that audiences could be impressed by the REAL FIGHT ! "
"However , it ' s just made fights for the sake of fighting ! Besides , the camera movement is just too shaky that I give up on the action scenes , or rather feel uncomfy towards the action scenes ( headache and dizzy ) . "
"It ' s alright to have "" shaky camera "" technique at times , like some Hollywood movies , BUT NOT overdone throughout the entire movie from the beginning to the end . The character development is seriously weak . "
"There is NOTHING about Mat Kilau , other than he is a leader and good in silat . "
"Also , we could hardly understand much about the characters of the FIVE ' brother fighters ' . "
The emotional and sentimental value is just NOT there enough to touch anyone . 
"As such , I could hardly feel anything , even though TWO of them died or anyone died in the movie . There is a scene whereby the villagers ( at last ) came to defend the land and fight against the British . "
"I supposed the director wanted to make an "" Avengers Assemble "" kind of goose - bump scene , BUT it failed badly . "
"And perhaps due to budget constraints , everything just ended abruptly . It leaves room for improvement in many aspects , as said above . "
"Oh ya , it ' s kind of violent with slaughtering and bloody scenes , so pls beware if you were to bring children to the movie . "
"After I watched this movie , I needs more happiness . "
"I FEEL THERE ' S LESS FACTOR TO CHEERS ! Some people like this movie , but others criticised the tone and its presentation . "
"To me , I felt the movies have many things that make me leap into the cliff . "
"But I don ' t blame the director and audience , but I blame myself for watching this action flick . "
"The story is okay , and the action sequences are exemplary yet cool , but those need some improvement like music , camera angle , dialogues and casting . "
"Before I watched this flick , I wonder how the majority of Malay friends flock to the cinema , maybe eagerly supporting the movie industry to thrive to the highest standards . "
"My point is , why this flick is the currently highest Malaysian film of all time ? "
"Oh , perhaps it ' s the message , the history , the Malays pride , and some religion ' s messages . "
"Maybe I was wrong , by the way . Malaysian films like Ola Bola , Sepet , movies of P . Ramlee etc , give me hope and excitement , on the other hand , this film feels weird and kind of out of place . "
"The film is pretty good actually , but when it comes to the message and the target audiences , the director needs to consider himself to unite the nation . Mat Kilau : Kebangkitan Pahlawan is surely a milestone for local creators , but I hope I could watch some more creative and cheerful films to deal with the problemata . "
"To those people who want to try , I ' d say : Frater et Sorrores , quidam veritas verba sanat . "
"This movie is shallow , peppered with preachy scripts and cliches . It needs a better writer . . . Character building is almost non - existent . "
"The protagonist appeared out of nowhere , was thrown into a leadership role and started preaching about nationalism and religion . "
This is followed by a cliche drama where another character is envious of the chosen leader . The preaching doesn ' t end there . 
It kept reminding you that the British were evil and tried to convince the viewers how important nationalism & religion were to them . 
This was done over and over againThis makes the protagonist one dimensional and they wasted such a good talent on this . 
"Some of the minor characters have better development than the protagonist . It needs breathing room . . . Some of the scenes jump around too fast , it seems as though they were rushing it in the editing room . "
Perhaps to include more preaching into the scenes ? Need some realism . . . . The costumes are inaccurate . 
"Modern clothing and clothing items were used and its so obvious , it will throw historians & anthropologist into a fit . The British soldiers are filled with entirely ' Punjabis ' . "
"Obviously , this wasn ' t the case in reality . To create epic fight scenes , they have Yayan Ruhian . "
"But it seems they wrote his character as an after thought . Conclusion . . . If you don ' t care about good storytelling , character development , screenplay and accuracy , you will most likely like this movie . If you appreciate good filmmaking and who goes to film festivals , you will want to skip this . "
Poor writing and storyline . 
Fake acting . 
Childish narrative on antagonist . 
Historically inaccurate doesnt mean the story have to be unrealistic . Though response from the local shows that malaysian simply judge local film by fighting act and cast presentation . Indonesian ' s Rudie Habibie for example does spent their plot on fighting and choreography . 
"But good character arc , less fighting , less screaming , less preaching . Another collection of trash from the Yusuf ' s . "
"The thing about Syamsul is he ' s a visionary directory , talented but he clearly needs to focus more on the writing department or just get someone who ' s better at this . Mat Kilau has its moment that you can truely feels its sheer epic scale and heightened your spirit of nationalism . "
The fight sequences were fairly good and really embodied the greatness of Silat . 
"To summarize , Mat Kilau is fast , action packed and straightforward formulaic biography that able to cater most Malaysians taste . Now the writing . . . The script is just lackluster and have Syamsul ' s trademark all over it . "
"It ' s very preachy and loud telling you "" Get up and fight for your country and religion ! "" . "
Is that bad ? 
"No , not at all . "
I understand the intention of sending some messages to the viewer ( and it clearly worked ) . 
But the gripe of having this kind of script is that it makes the character seems unnatural and very one dimensional . The pacing problem . 
It moves from scene to sceneway too fast that makes me lost the sense of time . 
And leaves the story unable to breath on its own . 
"This is likely a screenplay issue than editing . Mat Kilau , the titular role is very one dimensional and there isn ' t any interesting arcs to this character even though Adi Putra nails the character well enough . "
Even the character played by Beto Kusyairi has more depth to it . Some side plots and minor characters are hugely underdeveloped that they suddenly appeared near the end of the film . 
"I don ' t understand if Syamsul intended it to be a surprise or something but the outcome are meh without any of those build up . Overall , its a decent watch . "
Good effort by the team . 
Go watch and support Mat Kilau at the theatres . 
People will despise you if you dislike this film . 
I get it . 
I get the point of the movie in the first place . 
"But , at the end of the day , it ' s a film , and critics will always exist . "
"Even though it is a historical film and may be meaningful to some , there will always be people who focus on the details of the film rather than just enjoying it . "
"As for me , as a "" Melayu "" myself , I want this film to be as immersive as possible , especially given the historical setting . "
This demonstrates that Malaysian film quality lags far behind of other countries . 
"Even if the story isn ' t based on genuine events , it doesn ' t have to be implausible just because it ' s historically false ! This film lacked a great deal of attention to detail . "
All credits only go to the cast . 
"The cast was incredible and delivered a powerful performance in this film , but the rest was a colossal waste of potential . "
"If the director had not found the right cast in the first place , this film would have been a flop . The script is basic . "
They need to put in more effort on this front . 
The Malay accent is less accurate than it was in the 1980s . 
Consider P . Ramlee ' s films as an example . 
"The fight scenes are good , but the camera work is terrible plus the sound design is overused . This film doesn ' t even give me the classic 80s vibes that foreign films do . "
"The British actors too , their acting is terrible ! "
I cant stand it at allThe story is good ; I wouldn ' t call it bad . It takes the whole immersion away from this movie with the Sikhs ' actors as British soldiers . 
"It would be so great if they cast a real British actor for the soldiers , just to add more immersion to the story . Although it is enjoyable to watch , it is not even close to being considered mastery , despite what everyone says . "
"It does not have very much depth to it . If this is the level of quality that local people like and get excited about , Malaysia ' s film industry will continue to regress . And all the fuss and chaos from a few months ago is just too much . "
They give too much credit for this one . 
Be true to yourself . 
It is not Syamsul Yusof ' s greatest film . 
This movie is like a local drama . 
"Have you tried watching one ? The local simple , village folks might love it , as it is made for simple people . "
"It sells the idea of a warrior of the Malay people , which many are waiting to "" buy "" . "
"Even as it is not historically accurate , the least it can have is depth , which it doesn ' t . The story is pretty weak . "
The dialogues are laughable . 
Its like watching a 10 year old write a script . 
"They wanted to capture an original camera action , but it turns your stomach when you watch it . I forced myself to watch it ( just to see what was the fuss about ) , and it was a complete waste of my time . "
"I would never again watch it or suggest you to watch it , unless you have nothing except for this show on , even then , I would suggest you to switch off your tv and go do something else . "
"The storyline needs to be improved again , what I see in this movie is that there is no continuity from scene to scene , it ' s like there is nothing to do between the scenes . "
"Secondly , the main hero character , Mat Kilau , has no backstory and character development and that needs to be improved . "
"Third , the use of the Malay language needs to be further improved and the script needs to be further improved . "
"Finally , the camera movement needs to be improved again and what I saw in this movie , the camera movement is a bit chaotic , and shaky . What i like from this movie is Cinematography and action sequence also THIS MOVIE IS GOOD BUT IT CAN BE BETTER . "
THANK YOU . 
This film may get a kajllion dollars at the Malaysian box office however it will remain the most horrible film ever produced by the most popular director and it will haunt him to his grave . 
Syamsul Yusoff is Malaysia ' s Uwe Boll . 
He may produce and directs a lot a movies but had no actual contribution to the local industry itself collectively speaking . 
Disguising this movie as a semi autobiographical is a disrespect to Mat Kilau and his peers . 
"Infusing overtones of racism , bigotry , Malay Nationalism and Islamic virtue signal calling in it ' s script , this movie did not represent or tell the true intellectual depth of the malays and malayans at the said events in time . "
This movie only appeals to the far right sentiments and only divides the society as a whole . 
"Trash , trash , trash . "
"I just wasted my time watching this movie because everyone was talking about it and when Netflix released this movie , i decided to give it a go . "
"I struggled watching it on one go - paused every 10 mins and skipped most parts because it was so cringe . Adi Putra as Mat Kilau , the main character in the movie mentioned about Israel but during that period of time , there was no discussion of Israel in the region . "
"Unless if Mat Kilau is Ertugrul or Osman in the Ottoman Empire , then yes it ' s appropiate to mention Israel . "
Clearly this movie is so damn arabised . It ' s sad to see that the Malays still struggle to differentiate religion and culture . 
"A lot of the time in this movie , they preach so much about islamic teachings but not about the Malay culture that is ingrained into the culture . "
"If you watch Puteri Gunung Ledang , you can see how the Malays absorbed the islamic culture while retaining their own culture . "
The whole movie is so all over the place . Who even have the face to publish this movie ? ? ? ? 
It is true that we were being colonised by the British . 
Was the motive of the movie to just highlight that so that all the social warrior justice can preach how bad the British were ? 
"I ' m not saying the British were good , but for the person to put up content out there and warp the history to their own advantage - it ' s something i think it ' s messed up . I could also capture many Arabic words when they could ' ve just use a Malay word . "
 ( PS I AM A MALAY MUSLIM ) Are we all ashamed of being Malay that we rather be arabised ? 
Don ' t get me wrong . 
I love the spirit and I know what kind of message that SY has been trying to deliver . 
But man . . . it is badly made . 1 . 
Script2 . 
Action Scenes . 3 . 
Editing Sequence . 4 . 
Background Music . 5 . 
"Ending . Overall , I ' d say this is a good try la . "
Take this comment as a feedback into account and consider . 
All the weaknesses have been mentioned here by other reviews . 
"Screenwriting , jump cuts , camera works etc etc . My main complaint is how SY ended his film . "
"It just end abruptly , like TOO abrupt . "
I ' m all for film that ended on cliffhanger but there ' s literally certain style and technique to leave an impact to the viewer not just fade to black just after nothing remarkable happened before that . 
"When the credits kicks in I ' m just like "" That ' s it ? "" . "
Poor way to end a film that supposed to be an historical epic . 
"When I read about Mat Kilau in internet that he was found a hundred years later , I thought this movie is about his journey after quarreling with the British , his secret how he can survive , his love story , his "" war "" with himself . . . but it is not . "
"The dialogue between the casts are too fast , jump jump lompat lompat like there is no space to bernafas . "
Perhaps I am wrong then I compared to other Malaysian movies . . . yup I am sure the dialogue is too fast so I cannot catch the mimic of the casts . 
This movie didn ' t do justice to the great Malay warrior Mat Kilau in the struggle to fight off British colonial aggression . The acting was bad . 
The fighting scenes were mediocre . 
They could hire great British actors but chose to use really bad ' English ' actors whose acting skill are of low standard . 
In fact Geoff Andre Feyaerts who played British Captain Syers IS NOT EVEN an English . 
He is a Belgian . . . they might as well use an actor from Russian to play English captain 🤣🤣🤣I don ' t watch Malaysian movie often but watched this movie out of curiosity since I heard it did well at the Malaysian cinemas . 
I think Malaysian movies are still lacking quality ! 
More like a tv drama to me . 
MAT KILAU REVIEWLet me admit that I hate Malay films especially Syamsul Yusof films . 
"However , since my friends wanted to watch this movie so much , so I tagged along with them . "
"After all , this movie grossed RM2 million in 2 days and it ' s IMDB score is 8 . 1 so I could be wrong about Syamsul Yusof . NEGATIVE1 . "
PORTRAYAL OF THE BRITISH FORCESI taught Sejarah at a private school years ago and I love reading many history books . 
Although British committed many awful things to the natives but we must understand the degree of brutality of the many colonisers . 
"British weren ' t like Belgians in Congo ( who cut off body parts of babies because their parents didn ' t meet the daily quota ) , Turks ( in Armenia ) and Japanese ( who raped , murdered and mutilated 20000 Chinese women and girls in Nanking ) . "
British weren ' t stupid . 
They clearly understood that indiscriminate murders of innocent commoners will cause many protests and rebellions . 
"Hence , they only killed those who fought them . "
This also explains why the British empire managed to last for 250 years and colonized 54 countries . 
"However , British in this film are portrayed as stupid and short - sighted . "
"They committed mass murders of innocent civilians in at least two instances , murdered a pregnant woman and destroyed a market . 2 . "
THE FORCESThis film is about British colonisers . 
"However , you can see only 3 White people and all of them are holding the top positions . "
"The lower ranking soldiers are all Gurkha even though history tells us they were comprised of Malays , Gurkha and Englishmen . "
I can totally understand the budget constraints so they obviously can ' t pay European actors to act as extras . 
"However , why only Gurkhas as British soldiers ? 3 . "
THE DIALOGUE IMalays in the late 19th century didn ' t use flowery language . 
They spoke just like us . 
"Of course , gurindam , pantun , kiasan , rhythmic sentences were more common back then but they didn ' t have the time and energy ( especially after 10 hours at sawah ) to come up with some clever lines with deep meaning . 4 . "
"THE DIALOGUE IIFrom the very beginning to the very end the many characters talked about Malay ketuanan , Islam , the evil of infidel British and sovereignty of Tanah Melayu . "
It was non - stop for two hours . 
"Ok , I get it , the British were bad . "
Even at school we ' ve been reminded not to distrust strangers who come bearing gifts . 
You don ' t have to remind us a trillion times . 
"Instead of this , the screenwriters should spend more time on character development . 5 . "
"ILLOGICALIn one scene , the Gurkhas went to the market to collect tax . "
One of the sellers then protested by arguing that they never paid tax before so why should they pay now to infidel invaders . 
"I could be wrong , and I welcome correction , but taxation towards small Malay businessmen like them aren ' t the creation of British . "
Pembesar Melayu imposed it since hundreds of years ago . 
To say it was non - existence prior to British was wrong . 
"Then , during the final battle between the Gurkhas and the villagers , the British captain instructed to fire the cannon at literally all of them . "
You can see with your own two eyes Gurkhas died because of this cannon . 
"As I said , British are portrayed as stupid . "
These Gurkhas were their valuable assets . 
The cost of training them alone were in the millions . 
And don ' t let me start with the energy and time cost . 
"Plus , there ' s this one scene where Kilau said goodbye to his wife and son . "
Did you know where this scene took place ? 
At the top of a waterfall ! 
"I can totally understand the beauty of the scenery , especially in an epic film like this , but please be logical . "
"Finally , Wahid ' s wife wore anak tudung . "
Our Malay ancestors wore head covering but we can see their hair . 
"If you don ' t believe me , look at any pictures containing Malay women from 1890s to the 1950s . POSITIVE1 . "
FIGHT SCENESAlthough the fight scenes aren ' t as good as many kung fu films but they are enjoyable nonetheless . 
Far better than many Hollywood movies with mindless shootings from both sides . 2 . 
THE SCENERY3 . 
THE ACTORSThe acting is so - so but the warriors are muka jantan . 
"With the exception of Fattah Amin , all male warriors are brown - and dark - skinned . "
"In a film like this , you shouldn ' t apply any make up to the warriors . ⭐ ⭐Edit : I was told by someone that those British soldiers aren ' t Gurkhas but Punjab . "
"If that were true , I admit my mistake . "
"However , my question remains valid : Why cast only Punjab as British soldiers when in reality the soldiers were multiracial ? "
Theres a whole debate in a movie fan group over this film . 
Believe or not you can ' t give any negative opinion over this film because people regarded this as a sort of masterpiece and people will tell you in the face that you have to make your own movie before you can give any criticism for Mat Kilau . Tbh im never a fan of SY ' s works . 
He ' s like Zack Snyder except that he is way worse than him . 
He ' s all about style no substance but he got lot of fans that backed him up . I still paid the tickets to see this . 
Hoping that Syamsul will surprise me because the trailer and the hype is kind of promising . 
But no . 
This is like KL Gangster except that now Jai is Mat Kilau . 
I wouldn ' t call Mat Kilau as a historical film or biography . 
It ' s more like Syamsul only use the name to deliver his own ideology or message just like he did in his movies before . 
"The formula doesn ' t work here , it really doesnt . "
The actors kept shouting motivational quotes to your ear from beginning to end . 
Are there even real script here ? 
This is the best he can do ? 
I heard that the writers wrote the script with the messsage comes to their mind first . 
This is where the problem begins . 
The writers didnt even bother to create something that normal person would say . Did any of the cast and crew watch the movie before release it on cinema ? 
Did any of them even realise how disjointed the movie feels ? 
The transition is freakin awful . 
It felt like some kind of rough cut that supposed to sit in editing room . 
"If you feel like watching sermons or trailer for 2 hours , then this is your movie . Very poor plot and character building . "
"Can ' t understand why & to empathize with whom . Very fast transition , that in the word of my son - like watching a sketch on stage . Even the much hyped silat is only genuine for the first few opening moves . Script is nonsense . "
"It ' s ok to deliver a few patriotic message here & there but to have it in every scene in the most unrealistic way feels corny , preachy and annoying . I watched on Netflix but can only last for 20 min . "
And that ' s because my son was hyped by his classmate to watch . 
This kind of film embodies the extreme lack of taste that is widespread in the Malaysian film industry . 
"Action packed , but all meaningless and cringe The writing is awful . "
"If anyone remembers KL Gangster ( Also directed by the woeful Syamsul Yusof ) , this film is basically the historic version of it . "
Almost zero meaningful story . 
"It seemed like the great casts flocked only for the idea of making a Mat Kilau film , not a film about Mat Kilau . It ' s a great shame when a notable hero in history is used as a main character in a cheap watermelon action movie just to ramp up marketing and drive up sales . "
But who to blame again ? 
"It ' s the lack of taste among Malaysians , more so malays , that glorify this film as if it has any story telling of the actual history behind Mat Kilau . "
"Anyone who has zero idea who Mat Kilau was , will learn absolutely nothing after watching this film . The cinemas all over Malaysia were packed for over a month just for this film . "
Endless showtimes of Mat Kilau conquered it . 
Thor was cancelled and barely anyone complained . It ' s good that the film is celebrated like no other . 
But it ' s bad that it ' s for this tasteless film . 
"Wake up la Malays , This film is awful and crap . "
Nothing to bangga about . 
"It ' s dark times in Malaysian film industry and FINAS is a big blame for it . Last but not least , screw Syamsul Yusof , Zero talent and apparently he had the nerve to compare himself to Quentin Tarantino . "
"With your budget , that guy would stomp your project inside a week . "
Go get your rempit girl you left your wife for . 
Your art is a great shame of this country . 
Very good high budget Malaysia movies . 
Yes of course still have a few deficiency such as props and script writing . 
Good action fighting scenes . 
Great way to show Silat martial art to the world . 
Overall well done . 
Malaysia have a lot of brave history fight for independence but we keep doing horror and comedy movie . 
Thanks to Dali brothers we can see this kind of movie in the cinema . 
"Even though it is not too historical , just full of action pack with a glimpse of history . "
Its nice to have this kind of movie sometimes . 
Hope more to come . 
I was stunned to watch this movie . 
"The storytelling that pierces the heart , the great acting plays with emotions , the intense fighting scenes , the cast of dialogue that is very touching . "
"That is what I experienced while watching the undeniable film , the epic Malay film , MAT KILAU : KEBANGKITAN PAHLAWAN directed by the best Asia Pacific director Syamsul Yusuf . "
All the cast is great . 
It ' s fun to see Dato ' Adi Putra back in action again . 
"Beto Kusyairy ' s acting is the most solid , stealing my attention . "
I want Fattah Amin to act again in an action movie . 
"I cheered , cried , cheered , and cried throughout this movie . "
"Oops , I want to watch again ! "
I ' m still can ' t move on with this film . 
The film ' s is still being carried home . 
My siblings have already taken a Silat ' s step . 
Hahahah . 
The movie is worth it . 
My Rating 10/10 . 
"When they release this movie im so excited because i love shamsul movie and im want to be patriotic and help malaysian film industry but unfortunately the movie is worst terrible not because it a fiction based on true story not because the language or location but because of the script and the flow is so dam worst , you don ' t need to preach in a movie so that people can get something but if your movie is inspiring they will automatically trigger and learn . . the fighting scene is so amateur im so embrase with this movie . . 8 million budget feel like 80000 quality movie from start to end they preach serious and tension . . "
At first I want to give 5/10 but I got the feeling like the director paid a lot of people to make this movie overrated . 
"The fighting scene is okay , but need to update their sound effect . "
Don ' t use punching sound from KL Gangster . 
Overall its a okay movie . 
Shamsul should learn from Syafiq on how to make a good movie . 
👍🏼
Watching it as thr film received the hype and the RM100 million box office locally in Malaysia . 
How dissapointed I was when watching it on Netflix . 
"Bad cinematography , a so so fight sequence with lots of shaky camera , terrible scripts and not a good actings from the actors and actresses . At the rate this going , i wonder how would the local film be able to catch up with some other Asians movie quality . . . Take for an example , Indonesian martial art movie such as the awesome Raid . Mat Kilau looks low budget and definitely falls into a B grade movie in my opinion . "
What a great dissapointment for our local film . 
The cinematography is superb with the help of very experienced production team . 
The plot was so unpredictable and some scene will make you cry . 
Thank you to coreography lead by Yayan Ruhian ( Hollywood actor and stuntman ) which provide very energetic and impactful fighting scene . Recommended to watch and hopefully there will be Mat Kilau 2 . 
One of the best movie in history of malaysia . 
This kind of movie that i have being waiting in history of malaysia film . 
"Excellent job to our Asia best director "" Syamsul Yusoff "" . "
Please make more movie like this and more excellent movie . 
"I can ' t deny this film , the epic Malay film , MAT KILAU : KEBANGKITAN PAHLAWAN . "
Thank you to the best Asia Pacific director Syamsul Yusuf . 
All the cast is great . 
"I cheered , cried , cheered , and cried throughout this movie . "
"Oops , I want to watch again ! "
The film ' s handler is still being carried home . 
The wait is worth it . 
The movie is phenomenal . 
I watched this on Netflix and noted the almost 100mill ringgit returns from what i read . 
"Also noted there were some negative comments to those whom watched it on the big screens way back . . anyway , i watched it with open mind and was hoping that it would not disappoint me . Well , as much as i was enjoying it , i felt that it could be done better with better scripting/dialogue , better cinematography and better pacing especially when im into K Dramas and movies plus have watched similar genre produced by the Hong Kong counterparts like Wong Fei Hong series etc . "
"I love the genre , i love martial arts movies , love anything to do with no nonsense straight to the point kick ass movie , like similar the Raid , Berandal etc . . . however , i feel that this movie reached the highest returns for a malay movie only due to the theme of the patriotism which it tried to depict . . . especially when the country is grappling with so many political issues and hence the need to have such movie . . . In a way , it did touched me sentimentally , however it was overly used that it became too cheesy . . . the actors are good but they could be compensated with much better dialogues , story line and better cinematography especially the fighting scenes . . the worst for me was the fighting scenes . . . the cameras were shaking and why the need to put the soundtrack throughout the fighting scenes plus the sounds of the punches or kicking or hitting felt these were done back in the 80s with lesser technology . . . . potrayal of silat as a martial art could be much better with better cinematography or choreography . . . i am sure the director could have done better as i thoroughly enjoyed his KL gangster movies but maybe for some reasons he was not able to emulate the same for this . "
"Yes , it exceeded its targets tremendously but maybe not due to the strength of the movie but rather the current sentiments on the ground . . In summary , it meet the demand of the mass viewers but failed miserably in the movie itself . "
"Hope if it has part 2 or similar genre , the producing teams could have gone thru some of the room for improvements been said about the movie , to produce real epic movie . . . . "
Kuddos to Syamsul Yusoff . Hope this film will encourage more directors dare to step/invest into work on historical inspired film . I hope this film will encourage love for the country especially among young generation as the journey to achieve independence was not easy . Alfatihah utk Mat Kilau bin Imam Rasu . 
"Too much expectation from others , almost sold out everywhere where I live . The characters ' lines were so fast that I couldn ' t keep up with the tempo and they answered in less than a second . "
"And also the visual transition , especially at around 15 minute when the British talk , it change like every 2 - 3 second when they talking , it hurt my eye . "
"Tak tahu mana nak focus , mata kejap tengok kiri , pastu tiba2 kanan , kiri kanan , sakit mata . Some of the characters spoke very natural , some were like reading a book at school . I thought I was watching a movie about history , Director , too much fighting scenes , this is not KL Gangster . My wife fell asleep in the middle of the movie , I almost forgot I watched this movie , until it aired on Netflix . "
"Then I write this review . I ' m not good at English , this is all translated by deeplI don ' t know if there is a translation error . "
"The acting of the main cast was terrible , it didn ' t feel like the main actors of the main cast were giving in that much effort and heart , they acted too melodramatic . "
The acting of the villains was outright corny and garbage that it ' s laughable especially the British commander character . 
"The minor characters either acted very melodramatic or not even trying with their performances . The writing of this film was awful , all the characters . "
The good characters always give out long Islamic and nationalistic preaches to each other which felt very off and weird as actual people don ' t speak like that . 
Although the preaching lines had a certain charm to them . 
The villains ' lines were so cartoonish and corny . 
All the good guy characters have tremendous amounts of plot armour where the stakes don ' t feel high . The villains were very one - dimensional and generic . 
"There was no development in the main character . The characters never felt like actual humans due to the corny and very melodramatic lines and acting except Toga the actor played him quite well despite the melodramatic lines . The cinematography was dreadful , and the camera shots of the non - action scenes were generic and uninteresting . "
The cinematography of the action scenes was very shaky and messy and it was confusing sometimes . The editing was very choppy and muddled . 
They kept on cutting the fighting from one shot to another extremely fast without giving the shots time to show their glory . 
The way they edited the slow motion felt very weird and out of place . The fight choreography was decent and sort of entertaining to watch . 
"It could ' ve been much more entertaining without messy , shaky shots and very choppy editing . "
"Mat Kilau Was Totally Hit the scene , the Whole fight was Blown Away . "
I almost Open my Mouth when their fighting . 
And by that this is the most Grossing Movie Ever in Malaysia Standing Over 90M + 
"I am rating it 10/10 as not very often i got to watch superb historical narrative ( though fictional & borderline action genre in this case ) coming from my country & my language , something i can relate as a Malay Muslim . I do think the script is quite special in a sense that a lot of quotes are coming from the original sources of Islam ; Quran ( words of God ) & Hadith ( words of Prophet Muhammad SAW ) , relating to struggle against injustice & the sacrifices that have to be made . "
"For those with in depth knowledge of these , they ' d appreciate it even more , as this was the motivation of our ancestors when they struggled against colonialism . "
"For others without this exposure , it may sound preachy , but that was the driving ideal held religiously by those independent fighters ( mostly ) . I also do not expect those coming either from Western/British background/values , or indebted to the colonial power to appreciate the movie , as the movie tells it like it is , that British ' s colonialism in the land , was also supported by non - whites who later on became citizens of the newfound country of Malaysia . "
The movie depicted some of its characters as tools & mercenary of British to further oppress the natives/Malays . 
" ( AIthough I wished such stereotypical racial generalization within the context of multi - racial present days Malaysia should be minimized in the movie ) . Likewise , i don ' t expect the Jews to love Passion of Christ , the English to love Braveheart & the Italians to love Lion of the Desert , simply because they are portrayed as baddies in those movies , not necessarily because the movies were bad . The movie did its job to inspire the Malays to appreciate more of their heroes , Islamic values & heritage , which i found lacking in many Malay movies these days , thus the reason why it was widely viewed & appreciated by many among the Malay Malaysians . Budi , Miri , Sarawak . "
The most anticipated Malaysian movie 2022 already come out and exceed the expectation of every audience . 
This is by far the best action sequence in local movie ever . 
This movie deserves to be praised because not many local movie director can step up to direct the historical genre movie . 
Kudos to Syamsul Yusof ! 
" ! The movie is standing beside every masterpiece such as Puteri Gunung Ledang , Leftenan Adnan , Bukit Kepong and Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa . "
"The movie also had one of the best ensemble acting ever with a lot of A - list actor such as from main character ( Adi Putra , Fattah Amin and Beto Kusyairy ) to side character ( Namron , Dato Jalaluddin Hassan and Wan Hanafi Su ) . Still , there is a plenty of flaws that can be improvised . "
The fighting scene camera shot is so chaotic that make the audience cant focus to the scene itself . 
"Also , there is too much fighting scene that makes the movie lack of storytelling as the action is shown over and over again . "
"The script also too repetitive and boring sometimes . However , this movie deserves a high rating as it set a bar too high for local movie to be more succesful yet impactful like Mat Kilau ! "
 ! 
My benchmark for Mat Kilau would be the likes of Vikingdom and Merong Mahawangsa . 
"Mat Kilau is by far ahead of these movies . Of course we cant compare Mat Kilau with other genre so looking just within the Malay traditional movies , this is among the best since Puteri Gunung Ledang . I think its about time our Entertainment industry to start focusing on movies that holds traditional values and moral code from our historic roots . "
Enough with low class rempit and love movies . 
We need more movies to educate younger Malaysians about our rich history . 
"A dramatisation of true historical events that intrigued the crowd that it intended to & more . The plot progression is crazy , you move from one scene to another keeping the viewers engaged . While the performance from the protagonists are amazing , it was dragged down by the stark contrast of the weak performance by one of the main antagonists , Captain Syers . The dialogues ranges from amazing & inspirational to repetitive & monotonous . "
"Some fits the theme & plot very well , while others are too declarative ( in storytelling ) or out of nowhere ( Freemason & New World Order , what ? "
 ) Non - stop action & you won ' t get enough of the Silat choreographies . 
"While it left some Silat enthusiasts wanting more , it has attracted many younger generations . A very interesting theme , engaging story , good acting , successful social engagement . It has all the right factors to be good enough for it to take the Malaysian film industry AND Malaysians by storm . This movie not only brought a breath of fresh air for Malaysian ' s expectations of local films , but a step towards the rise of a nation . "
For that it deserves + 1 . 
This story of Mat Kilau refers to a legendary warrior hero of the late 19th century who fought against the English empire . 
The local general is quite brutal against the inhabitants of Pahang Continuous discords between the local people help him to get even more arrogant for money and power and making continuous atrocities against them in order to take what he thinks to deserve . 
Killing or murdering bullying and the same . 
This was helped also with two men from the today Indonesia excellent in martial arts and exceptionally strong . 
His soldiers are Sikhs ie Indians with the help ofThis is surely an exaggeration . 
When I was in Nigeria sometime ago and knew that English authorities are a bit demanding but not doing atrocities against the locals . Mat Kilau is a smart person with good verbiage and was given the lead of the local people to uprise against the English . 
The unity and faith to the God are also the keys to make them united . The only problem is the very long fight scenes with silat the Malaysian version of Kung Fu with a few very violent scenes . 
"Its clear that the narrator has not so much to show otherwise the movie could last around 40 - 45 minutes Think of around 50 % with fights and 10 % referring to religious beliefs ( Islam ) and remain of story ' based of ' , no the real . The movie has also a good filming , lots of vague points , much of exaggeration but still gets quite good . "
"Despite all the negative reviews , the collection for this movie in the cinemas speaks otherwise . "
"It is one of the fastest movie to reach 23 million MYR in a week , triple the producing cost which is 8 million MYR . "
Showtimes in every 15 - 20 mins in full house hall is build different . 
"The producer did his homework to target the local market . In my opinion , Some of the critics is irrelevant as the only way they can improve is by spending more money which could burst producer ' s budget . So what is behind the Mat Kilau ? "
"First , just like avengers movies , they assemble the top actors then perform in rare genre of movie . "
"The genre which is what Malaysia needed for a long time . Second , the take away message from this film is superb ! "
"It is not only impact individual personality , but also the community as a whole . "
The message hit the target right on the spot . 
It is very relatable to our nation . It is a good movie when you dont even realize you have spent 2 hours in there as it packed with actions and important scenes . Record breaker ✅Impactful to community ✅Full of actions from top actors ✅
Malay or Muslim will understand the root meaning of this film . 
We are proud and waited for so long for this kind of movie . 
"This movie tell the hard truth about Malay . As other audience , you will enjoy the fast pace , superb action scene , deep and strong characteristic of this movie . . . . As the movie ends , i wanted to watch it again as its was super good . "
There is no similar movie to this . 
This is truly a masterpiece for the ketuanan folks who want an action movie with cheesy razzie - award like acting and dialog . 
Someone should have stopped the filming mid way and assessed what they have shot . 
"This movie would be studied by amateur film makers in the future on how not to mess up a fictional tale . Unfortunately when a movie like this receives majority 10 votes , it is a true reflection on the majority that watches this malaise and are affected on the propaganda . "
I do hope there will be a sequel that can mix and blend horror genre and hantu pocong . 
"I do believe that will be a better combo , at least then you can say see the ghost has better acting than the lead actor . "
Good start for silat film . 
Expecting more producer create a malaysian historial movie in future . 
This is good sign that we could compete with any foreign blockbuster movie . 
Although i dont like the fighting scene camera ( shaky & fps drop ) which is similar with KL gangster movie . 
Its a great start indeed . 
"To all of you that condemned and saying that this is not a accurate history stroyline , this is actually an inspired storyline . "
Doesn ' t need to be specific and accurate details . 
Same like any blockbuster movie ( IP Man ) . 
We need Mat Kilau Part 2 ! ! ! ! 
 ! 
Because in Malaysia long time not have history movie so this amazing . 
"Actually many warrior in Malaysia like mat kilau , such as tok janggut , tok bahaman , tok gajah an ext . We know our country protect from ulamak . . . im even not eat popcorn while watch . . "
"The movie had pretty good martial arts , a little over the top . "
It is too bad that 90 % of the film was about proselytizing Islam . 
"The worst part is that the the just cause for rising up was the murderous and rapacious attitude of the Brits . While Islam did exist in the region , and while it is known that Islamist expansionists wreaked havoc in the region forcing conversion for many years before this time , the issues were never about Islam , but about Colonial enslavement . I did like that the truth was told that the leaders sold out the people for self advancement and wealth . Sorry , but the movie just proved to be made to advance Islam rather than tell a story . "
One of the patriotic movie been made so far . 
"It make a lot of haters that don ' t share the same patriotical heart , those who are not originally from sacret land , Tanah Melayu ! "
"If you are one of those who interested to know how on earth the Malay survive until now without having changed dramatically post independant in term of moral and spiritual , you can watch this film but I bet not everybody will understand the message this film is brought . "
"If you expect to see some hunky bunky science fiction like spiderman or Marvel superheroes , I am afraid you will get none from this film . "
"Those who gave low rating for this film most of them are Ini Kalilah film fan that has tremendous budget but little tiny profit , not even in box office list . "
LOL . 
Didn ' t expect every scene were very precise & clean . 
"Lot of themes in storyline inc . Fighting , love , patriotism & soul value ! Wajib tengok . "
Cerita memang menusuk kalbu . 
Harap lepas ni akan banyak lagi movie yang bermakna macam ni . Worth every dollar spent . 
Much love . 
Good job & salute to all the producers team . Must watch ! 
Waiting for another big movie from this producer . 
All aspects of cinematograhy are perfect and awesome . Mat Kilau should remain Adi Putra as the main character for sequel movie . Make it trilogy version ! 
"Watching this movie just to get the feels before I see the new spin - off movie Pendekar Awang : Darah Indera Gajah ( 2024 ) . To be honest , I laughed more than I cried . "
The film has many potentials but missed its golden opportunity . 
"There were already lots of discussions so I ' ll shorten my thoughts below . . POSITIVES : + It has a decent cinematography overall . + The action scenes displaying the indigenous martial arts Silat was also good and entertaining . + High production value . + The original soundtracks are okay . . NEGATIVES . There were some interesting storylines that I feel were done poorly such as Kilau ' s wisdom in leading the Malay uprising , Wahid ' s anger and avenging his wife , Awang ' s redemption arc after his failed plan cost some lives . "
It could have shown a good character development . 
This based on true story film sets a new standard to the Malaysian film industry . 
Well done to the producers and the crews . 
Love it . 
Love it . 
Love it . 
Well done . 
Hope to see more of malay warrior films in the near future . 
The genre of the movie is historical action drama . 
"It based on true event that was taken place , it is being commercialised but the real touch about the Islamic values in story line does depicted to the real story of Mat Kilau Rahimahullah . "
So to me it is always better than 100 % fiction . 
This is more than entertainment . 
It is beneficial and informative . 
"The main thing i love about the script in the movie is that there are many utterance in the name of Allah and the right use of Wisdom from the Quran and the Sunnah , i just love it and it was respectfully used in a proper way and also there are many real life advice that is applicable to our life . "
"Alhamdulillah , i have nothing against it i give 10/10 . "
Superb and fantastic . 
This film will be the most historical achievement ever in the century . The martial arts is awesome . 
The cast very smart . Superb and fantastic .

"Waiting for another outcomes . . Expecting many more adaptations of epic hero figures such as Tun Fatimah , Tok Janggut , Maharaja Lela , Rentap , Mat Lela , and others . "
"At the same time can be used as an example and lesson to open the eyes of the world regardless of race , tribe or religion by defending the homeland from the invaders . "
"As the proverb says , Malays will not remain with custom , sultanate and culture alone . "
But we will be noble because of our faith if we stick to Islam . 
That is where the glory of the real Malays lies . 
"Oh my brother , Allah is our strength , to find strength seek for Allah ! "
Im on 100 % cringe face watching the whole movie . 
"For the local quality , who am I to complained . "
"More like 2 weeks school project , i don ' t think they make any research for "" mat kilau "" era aspect . "
Just slap some names and voila ! 
"Am 100 % sure this movie won ' t even reach the "" Malay "" bounders . "
"Sorry for the harsh comment , but director need to be slap some sense . The super clean white cloth scene on muddy field , hm . "
I think you can do more than that director . 
Less crying more speak and action . 
"So many scene all cry cry , mat kilau himself also cry . "
"Unrealistic drama , very bad scene transition . "
"The plot all around the places . I saw a better silat fight , in this movie was the worst I seen . "
Research brother . 
My old guy waiting at home to slap some knowledge to you . 
"Well I watched the whole movie , for my friend sake . Adi Putra acting is good though . "
"But script is very bad in many ways , and please less crying . "
7 star out of 10 for Adi Putra acting . 
1 star for the whole movie . 
It was good that Mat Kilau : Kebangkitan Pahlawan was shown on Netflix as it gave me flexibility to watch the movie at my own pace . 
"As the movie was shot in 4K and with its sound effects , my 5 . 1 system and an OLED screen was sufficient enough to support the screening , to get the best possible sound and visuals . "
"Clearly stating it here in case if i get those "" ko tengok kat Netflix , apa yg ko tahu "" reactions . Within the first 30 minutes , it was a challenge to watch it till the end . "
"I will sum it up in my review below : Script , Screenplay : The script was poorly written and the dialogues were monotonous . "
"It had no flow except that catchy lines in the tones of "" race , religion , motherland , ancestors "" was seen repeated by various characters throughout . "
It was like reminding the audience endlessly of what the Malay race is and how evil the British forces were . 
There were one too many occurrences where dialogues sounded more like a ceramah or from a prayer session . 
This was needless as it sunk the movie in its plot . Characters of the film were not developed well as the movie progressed . 
"The protagonist was suddenly introduced out of no where , thrown right in the role of a leader and most of his conversations were about race , religion and tanah pusaka . "
"The movie titled after him didn ' t allow a chance to develop his character . In fact , the most of the characters were under developed . "
"This is due to a very weak screenplay . Production , Photography : It was nice to see the director opting for the 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio as it gave a pleasant cinematic feel with its widescreen cinemascope format which suited cinema screens and modern LED/OLED displays . The cinematography of this film was mediocre and the lighting was horrid . "
There was no craft or as it is that the DOP had limited creativity . 
Lighting was inconsistent throughout and the ambient light was seen so fake that even the glare and flickering seemed to be operated by someone who lacked experience . 
This film was set in a time where there was no electricity supply but surprisingly indoor lighting felt like there were several LED lamps being operated . 
The jungle and the village exterior were lit up as though there was one spot light used by the residents there . Camera angles were limited and consistently repeated . 
"It was mainly of a low angled static shot , a tracking shot at a single angle or a shot craned up . "
It was boring . 
"Again , the DOP seemed clueless with expanding his shots or applying creative techniques . The fight scenes were the most painful to watch . "
The choreography was acceptable but the camera movements were just horrid . 
It gave a dizzying feel and at times I felt nauseated . 
"A proper gimbal or a steadycam would have done wonders but again , it boils down to the expertise of the operators in whether they would have had the knowledge to operate one . "
Watching those fight scenes felt more like being seated at the back of a 4 wheel drive vehicle going through a jungle ride . 
It was nauseating . What was also lacking were B - rolls . 
"B rolls are supplementary shots for example scenic shots of landscapes , natural elements or subjects that are used as transitional elements in a film . "
"It explains the lack of creativity by the film director . Production Design : I must say that the production design of this film was poor , very poor indeed . "
"When it concerns a periodic film , detailing is key . "
"Elements such as sets , props and costumes are integral and should be designed to engage with the times the film was set upon . The props looked new or polished , there was no aging process applied . "
The set where it portrayed a jetty seen to be something that was recently made . 
The wooden boxes at the ambushed area were all too neatly arranged pr stacked . 
The art direction was poor . The tents at various spots such as the gold mine and the village were all squeaky clean . 
"Too clean , not being weathered down . "
"Again , the art director failed miserably in execution . Props at the market were all too neat , prim and proper . "
It gave a feel of a pasar tani in a modern civilised era . The costumes used were all ironed well and looked tardy despite the story background of its rural and rough setting . 
Some looked as though they were just picked up from a local boutique minutes before filming . 
"Again , there was no aging process applied on the wardrobe . "
A mediocre work by the stylist . Make up on characters were like they were all going for a wedding . 
The colour tones applied were not right for the film and lighting . 
"But of course when the lighting was bad enough , make up applied will look equally bad . Locations were merely some boring urban jungle or landscape . "
"As locations looked redundant , more effort should have been put on cinematic looking scapes . "
The sets at locations were relatively dull and looked brand new . Casting : Adi Putra ' s character of Mat Kilau was poor . 
"Most of his serious dialogues or ceramah were like watching Arnold Schwarzenegger ' s portrayal of the Terminator , robotic and dull . "
Even his expressions were unreal and his machoism was overwhelming . 
"He was monotonous at most times . In fact , Beto Kusyairy was a better performer . "
His portrayal of Wahid brought some character in depth even though there were times where he seems to be way over emotional . Yayan Ruhian ' s character of Toga was commendable . 
"The only odd thing about it was that he sounded exactly like who he was , an Indonesian . "
"But perhaps , his intonation and dialect could have been the accurate overall setting for the film if it was used widely in the film . "
"Some call it the "" old Malay language "" . I believe that choosing a Belgian with a heavy Flemish - sounding English for a role of a British soldier was a wrong move . "
Geoff Andre Feyaerts was poor mainly in the command of the English language in terms of intonation and pronunciation . 
"And yes , the make up on him was equally horrible . Having a handful English or Caucasian individuals as part of the British Regiment was also a poor choice and with the entire force made out of Punjabis was just plain silly . The character of Ghuram Singh was poor acting . "
It was kinda surprising to hear a Punjabi from the British army in 1892 speaking a modernised version of the Malay language with much fluency and flair . 
"And so were his own Punjabi co - stars . I was also surprised with Goh Hoi , played by Farid Amirul for his impeccable command of the English language . "
"Seriously , his character never made any sense in the plot . I wouldn ' t want to say much of the other characters but they were portrayed accordingly by accomplished actors such as Rahim Razali and Jalaluddin Hassan . Post Production : The film lacked creativity in terms of edits . "
"First and foremost , the grading was off as it didn ' t give a look and feel of that era but again , tones of colour grading is usually the director ' s choice . Scenes looked like they were slashed here and there and then glued up together to create a sequence . "
The slow - mo effect was used frequently for the same type action and it became boring quickly . Visual effects were mediocre . 
The bombing scenes and where certain soldiers seen burning were pathetic . 
"Again , another hurriedly done shoddy job . The movie started off with a scene where a title design was used at the foot of the frame . "
"It was written as "" Kuala Tembeling , Pahang ( 1890 ) . "
The font used in there was a modern typography . 
"This too explains the lack of knowledge and creativity . Music , Sound Design : Despite the frequent yelling of bangsa Melayu , tanah pusaka and what not , there was not even a single music tune with Malay origins . "
"The music score largely sounded like compositions from Hans Zimmer , John Williams or David Arnold . "
Even the silat sequences was backed with a westernised orchestral music . The sound design was just mismatched as though it sounded like a modern ninja film but with a 1700s backdrop . 
The foley artist failed miserably to enhance or create realistic sound effects . The Ending : This was baffling . 
"It was weak and clueless , left hanging but not as a cliffhanger . "
Characters like Capt . 
Syers disappeared just like that . 
There isn ' t a proper closure except for the repeated sermons on race and religion . Overall : I would give the movie 2/10 . 
Good effort in some ways but mediocre results . The significant positivity of this movie was that it made more than RM90 million at Box Office . 
"A remarkable achievement and having said that , the producers knew exactly what to ride on in making it highly appealing to the mass . And , it also created a new legion of pendekar and pahlawan with kids starting to attend silat classes . "
"That is classy , getting a chance to embrace culture . As for penyatuan ummah , this movie is just another platform to encourage unity just like how the "" Buy Muslim First "" and "" Anti - ICERD "" initiatives first came by and fizzled out in no time . "
The movie didn ' t even have a decent storyline to begin with . 
There ' s no realism for example a man bare handedly defeated six guys with rifles is just totally childish and ridiculous writing . 
And how the bullets never land on them except for that one time in the ending where they didn ' t got killed when they ran recklessly towards an army with cannons ( the cannonballs just magically teleported behind them ) . 
And how there ' s always some bad guys in the background with rifle just stand there without shotting . 
The inconsistency of the story when awang make a deal with british and break it that night making the deal made by him to conceal their intentions seem worthless . 
The beautifully prepared sets being wasted over bad cinematography . 
Talented actors being wasted over bad script . 
Time that could had been use for character development are wasted over a long meaningless fight scene . 
Make me feel nothing when the pregnant wife got killed as she is soo underdeveloped to make me care about the character at all . 
"Beside good choreography of fighting this movie is lacked of emotion , plot , character development , good writing and even have no beautifully shot scene . "
"I was expecting something decent , maybe not as good as Bukit Kepong but at least to that quality . "
"It ' s not . Storyline was all over the place , scenes cut jump with no flow . Dialog mostly meaningless , more concerned of saying motivational poemy sentence than frankly speaking from the heart . "
"Trying too hard to motivate the Malays from start to end , it gets tiring very quicklyNo character building . "
I feel more towards Ratatouille the mouse than Mat KilauCharacters would look more believable not so well groomed with ironed striking color clothes . 
"But this can be considered minor , still acceptable compared to other fall points of this movieI understand that Syamsul is not trying to make this a historically accurate movie , maybe more of an action movie , but then , action wise , a lot of illogical scene like how can Mat Kilau survived a fight scene where 5 - 6 British soldiers are pointing guns directly at him and he ' s fighting back one at a time with bare hands ? Camera shake during fight scenes are over the top , it might cause headache to some . "
"It ' s maybe a technic , but in this movie , way too muchGood try for a Malay movie , but definitely not as good as it ' s hyped on , many more better Malay movies out there . "
First and foremost let me say i am not the target audience for whom this movie was made so naturally Mat Kilau failed to hit all the spots for me . 
The fact is though one make a film like Mat Kilau and still hit the right spots with non - target audience . 
"As a non - Caucasian I enjoyed foreign patriotic movies like Mel Gibson ' s ' The Patriot ' , ' Braveheart ' , ' Glory ' even though i am not American or Irish as those films were well made . Mat Kilau though is pure adulterated extremist propaganda aimed at a particular segment , that being the Malays of Malaysia . "
"There ' s nothing wrong with that as one can still make such films and as long as they are well made , I am the sort of person that can still appreciate the effort . "
Mat Kilau ' s failings though are too numerous to ignore or give a pass . Firstly the story . 
"In a nutshell , the movie is based on a real life anti - colonial Malay rebel who resisted the British in Malaya in 1890s . "
Telling this story should have been straightforward and embellishment for the sake of entertainment is too be expected and in fact needed ! 
Where the film fails terribly is the writing and casting department . Mat Kilau for one is Gary Stu who embodies everything the modern Malay surpremacist dreams about . 
He ' s a devout Muslim and every 2nd sentence out of this character ' s mouth is some form of nationalistic nonsensical rant about driving out the evil British and how Allah alone is all they should depend on . 
Mat Kilau comes across as single - minded and bland with nothing else to his character other than his extreme nationalistic and religious views . It ' s actually up to his fellow freedom fighters to give some more development as the spouse of one of them is against his involvement in the rebellion . The next big problem is how everyone who isn ' t a Malay is a traitor working for the British . 
The token Chinese character is helping the British . 
"The two Borneo mercs whom the British employ are the only assets capable of holding their own in combat against Mat Kilau and his friends while the British colonial Sikh troops employed by the British come from the same school Star War ' s stormtroopers . This leads us to the next big problem , the movie ' s villains . "
The chief villain is British officer Captain Syers who is such a comically evil character that it ' s hard to seriously see him as any threat . 
"Whilst the aforementioned Mat Kilau is a Gary Stu who can do no wrong and hardly breaks a sweat as he slaughters waves of Sikh soldiers , Syers is Saturday morning cartoon bad guy whose every line of dialogue is equally comically written . "
"His lines are so bad , it borders on cringe . "
As the commander of the British effort Syers advocates measures that are literal genocide as his Sikh underlings commit mass slaughters of Malay civilians . 
"If the real life British were this inept it ' s a wonder how they defeated every Malay rebellion against them . What ' s more Syers here is shown as a stereotypical blonde - haired devil with - check this out BROWN EYES - but they clearly hired some clown to do his make up as the actor who plays him has dark hair , is not even British and doesn ' t even attempt put on a semblence of an English accent . "
"The poorly done fake blonde hair coupled with the actor ' s obvious real brown eyes ends making Syers look like a literal clown . Then there ' s the fight scenes . . . every fight scene is an extended drawn - out affair whether it ' s Mat Kilau and gang mowing down waves of Sikhs soldiers , or 1 - on - 1 duels with the Borneo mercenary duo , the main Malay fighters always taking a chance to strike a cool pose in the middle of a fight ! For the record the real - life Mat Kilau ' s rebellion was eventually defeated when British pressure compelled the local Malays to betray and surrender the rebels . "
This is a huge point to make cause it needs reminding that every non - Malay in this film is either a traitor or helping the British . 
The fact that the real - life Mat Kilau and his friends were turned in by other Malays stands in huge contrast to the drug - addled written copium of this film . 
"Lead actor Adi Putra has decent lines and good choreography in fighting , and at the same time , has been overshadowed by overacting Johan Ashaari . "
"I don ' t know why , Johan acting like that ? "
"Have a dream about bringing back Oscar trophies or what ? The dressing part is too clean , like just out of the laundry , and it should seem more poor/shabby - looking clothes to cope with the real - life situation . "
One character that bothers me a lot is Captain Syers . 
Why on earth should you dye his beard and hair too yellowish color ? 
Don ' t you refer to any real British with natural blonde ? 
"For example , "" Mat Salleh Cari Makan . "" "
"That Capt looks like he suddenly trips into the yellow dye pool . That one guy , Awang , acting with no emotions at all . "
"If there was an apocalypse happen infront of him , maybe still there like no action at all . "
"If the director put a broom stick imitating/substitute him , still more action than him . Lastly , if anything mentioned above cannot be undone because of budget or time consumption , please go for a film filter . "
"Refer Ong Bak 3 picture style , how they dim the lighting/saturation and all . "
"Your movie , looks more like a soap opera or drama , not feel like watching a movie . "
"I want to support Malay films , but not like this kind of standard . "
"Director , please refer to the late Mamat Khalid movies on how to dress an actor/actress to look like a real - life kampung person or environment . 3 Stars for afforts . "

Mat Kilau Happy Family . 
Screen shooting was on par with moves in the film . 
This was first malaysian movie to have that type of Hollywood show with real sound effect etc . 
This is must watch show . 
Good enough . 
There are lot of lessons learned . 
"Much better No Music , because if there is , you ' re mind will tell you to watch other movie with music and not to finish , maybe you ' re thinking about other movie , just watch at night time , just like I did . "
"I felt boring at first 2 minutes but after 5 minutes watching , I understand . "
"Save your people , not yourself , the way to listen to the better one . I don ' t know about Malay . "
But they are brave enough and religious and honest as what I watched no music and it is better than with music that has a lot of edits just to get people attention . 
"As what I see on the movie , full of action and history . "
I really learned a lot . 
"Intrigued by the box office hype , I knew I had to watch this flick . "
Below are my comments : 1 . 
StorylineThe movie centres on the gradual imposition of British rule in Pahang . 
The situation escalates when taxes are imposed on commerce and culminates in the rebellion by the Malay masses led by Mat Kilau and friends . It would have made a more complete story if the background of Mat Kilau and his warrior friends had been included . 
The instrumental role of Tok Gajah in rallying the masses could have give added strength to the plot . My rating : 6/102 . 
"CinematographyThe quality of cinematography is very impressive , as good as a Hollywood production . Nevertheless , the deliberate "" jerking "" of fight scenes was rather off putting . "
The fight scenes are definitely a boon for avid martial arts fans . 
One of the reasons why I stopped watching the Transformers franchise is the endless mind numbing fight scenes . My rating : 7/103 . 
Sound EditingThe overall sound editing is highly commendable . The amplified sound of punches and kicks is really unnecessary . 
"Luckily , it wasn ' t in the same category of Tamil movies . My rating : 8/104 . "
"ScriptThe script was well written , replete with classical Malay sayings . "
"Strong emphasis is placed on the inseparable bond between Malay and Islam . With other Malay movies and dramas , the script leans very heavily on formal Malay rather than the layman version . The scriptwriter inadvertently had Mat Kilau utter "" emosi "" , a word which is definitely not in use in that era . It is quite puzzling that the characters do not use local Pahang dialect in their dialogue . "
One could be forgiven for thinking that the characters lived in Selangor . My rating : 6/105 . 
CostumeCredit to the wardrobe Manager for dressing the entire cast in period costume . 
My only grouse is how new the clothes donned by the cast looked . 
Definitely not your day to day use attire . My rating : 7/106 . 
Musical scoreThe musical score used throughout the film brings fresh energy to the scenes . 
"Of course , having a full orchestra backing in the musical score could have taken the film to dizzying heights . My rating : 7/107 . "
Acting performanceAdi Putra ( Mat Kilau ) and Yayan Ruhian ( Tago ) are easily the stand out performers . 
It would be easy to imagine Adi Putra donning a Batman suit and speak in a husky tone ala the Dark Knight . Yayan potrays the badass mercenary to a tee . 
Perhaps Tago ought to have remained unassociated with Borneo . 
He definitely didn ' t sound Borneoan . 
"Sounding very Indonesian , naturally , could negatively impact at the Indonesian box office . One of the royal court characters spoke very much like a performer in a play . "
"Again , most characters didn ' t sound natural , as mentioned earlier . My rating : 7/10Overall rating : 7/10In summary , the movie is worth the ticket price . "
Syabas to the filmmakers for producing a first class film . 
Let ' s dream big . 
Mat Kilau has the potential of reaching out to an international audience if the suggestion for improvements are made and turning the dialogue into English . Could the runaway success of Mat Kilau signal the start of a legendary Malay warrior franchise ? 
How about bringing the struggle of Dol Said of Naning to the big screen ? I sincerely wish that one day a collaboration between Malaysian and Portuguese film makers will tell the story of the fall of the Melaka empire . 
"1511 , anyone ? "
"Its about time this type of movie which is based on actual event get to be screen and watch my people to know more about our malay history , fight scene is great . "
Thank you to syamsul Yusof for this .
