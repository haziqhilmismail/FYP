"Invite the people to boycott the upcoming box office movies that will be released soon . Don't forget that the movie industry is also their biggest contributor , what's more , the movie Wonder Woman clearly shows the perpetrators of the Jewish race . Try to see the movie in the Mat Kilau country box office in our country alone , how much has it collected . "
"always proud of what our nation can achieve . I support local films . To do better we need to compete productively . In this era , the source of movies is limitless . Ola Bola , Mat Kilau to name a few are all local blockbusters . Give it sometimes for local films to grow . "
"about reading a book to know this history , I once talked to someone who saw the movie Mat Kilau and completely believed what he showed . when I told him to read a book , he said I don't know Malay . I'm too lazy to debate with people who want to go to the toilet"
MALAYSIANS remember when we were all obsessed over Mat Kilau (the movie)? especially the girls when we thought some of the 6 casts were
"I don't even quote Mat Kilau because I know his history is not the same as what I read in the book , so people use the movie as an ideology . Sometimes I ask the gangs who watch this movie if there are certain scenes that don't follow history"
remind me there is a parade from the cast of the movie eramalat cuz last year there was a mat
"But honestly , Mat Kilau is not very strong plot-wise . The movie has strong support because it has a political element"
"There is a Kanang Anak Kankau movie . Even made earlier than Mat Kilau . The women just make it worse , they say we are racist towards them . Very influenced by the black narrative"
"If the movie follows the historical facts about Mat Kilau , it will look 10 times more supremacy because he really fought all the way . His life story is sad . He was under-appreciated"
Just watched Sultan Agung on Netflix . I must say every single thing in this movie is far beyond better than Mat Kilau . Story telling: 10 Plot: 10 Script: 10 Cinematography: 9 Acting:
I don't think that's the reason . The people are now ready to vote . . nonsensical stories have no essence . What do you want to support? Example of movie mat
"Tbh right now , you gimme one podium and i read out what i have , i sound like im in the mat kilau movie"
Mat Kilau movies like that are also high-grossing . Good quality Evo police can't even get the collection they deserve . 
"In my experience doing startup is investors will put money in ventures that they can relate with . So I guess FINAS people are those who like these kinds of movies , not Star Wars , Shutter Island and Mat"
"Where? We were in MMU Theater competitions together . Perempuan Itu (long time no TV especially Malay drama) is it Isma's? For years I never followed , last Malay stories I watched was Mat Kilau & the aviation movie"
Uncle . I just finished watching Extraction 2 . Sol Mat Kilau shot the movie
"You have to make a quality movie to lift your spirits History - ""Mat Kilau"" BM - BI - Math - Science"
"Just look at the Mat Kilau of the movie , how do you know how to use history as you see fit . Don't look at it comprehensively . The one who makes the movie and the one who watches the movie . The mentality is the same"
"Polis evo 3 is good . It's not powerful , but it's delicious . I don't think it's a waste to watch a local movie like this near the cinema . Light plot . Action sequence is nice , even better than Mat Kilau in terms of sound and camera angle . The armor plot is thick , but if you look at one piece , you don't even complain . "
Just watched polis evo 3 . Was an okay movie . Predictable plot . 6/10 for me . BOOT!! Everyone else laughed and enjoyed the movie so much . Ready to get applause from people in the movie hall . But this one can get applause better than the Mat Kilau movie
"Ermm . . it feels like there are many free tickets at mat kilau . . I got free tickets at mat kilau 4 times . . police evo 3 twice . . I haven't been able to get this anwar untold story because it's fun to run out of free ones . . just like any free movie I've ever had I don't know hahahah . . if it's possible , I'll do it like this for another movie"
"So movie bangnon with Mat Kilau , where else? Dialogue , story line , "
"Mat Kilau . The advertisement is too much . I was also affected . When I saw it , I stopped . 1 old plot . Cinema even gives full slots/day instead of 4 slots/day per cinema movie"
"Make fun of him because he doesn't focus on the story line and then tears up . . The message of the movie is good and important , there is no touch plate . You're just dizzy"
"Both are not the best . Objectively speaking , this movie opened strong then withered as an unnecessary PSA that made the ending feel abrupt . Mat Kilau was horrifying in terms of blatant propaganda packaged as a warrior"
"Example for me , I strongly disagree with reviewers who say Mat Kilau is the best . I don't like the other movies he recommended . So I ignore him . Chris Stuckkman(?) recommends a lot of stories that I like . There are a few that don't match but so far I'm satisfied"
"To this day , I'm strange , how did Mamat turn the movie review for a high rating on that Mat Kilau . When he reviews , he always emphasizes the aspect of cinematography , but in Mat Kilau , it is badly destroyed . The cackling camera is too bad . Campelaq . That's the one"
That's the quantity . Great a movie based on quality not quantity . That's the level of taste Malaysians want to make . Do many Malaysians watch the highest rated movie worldwide? That's why it flopped when it entered the Indonesian market . The quality of Indonesian movies is much better
"Why did I think of Bell? Hahahaha eheh Beto in Mat Kilau . After the movie , he eclipsed everyone1 I think . This Raya , his face is everywhere! + The star moon & the sweet fat song are over"
"Mat Kilau , the first movie in my life . Soo next we wait , Malbat Mission Bakara | Black Hawk Down . If history he follows what America and the West write . Auto"
"because I don't know you very well , not because of race . If Chin View is making a movie with Mat Kilau and Yusof Haslam's son or the devil boy actor , what's the point? lol . like the case of shooting a pregnant wife , because the perpetrators are not female so there is no hype . That's because of him"
what if Malaysia were to make a film on Mahsuri history? would it have a great feedback and engagements such as Mat Kilau and other historic
"Many movies I've seen in the cinema , but the movies are the most wasteful . It's more hype than the story , it's biased , it's more of a war scene"
i saw munafik and mat kilau movies and i feel like they are made are made for boring people it is so . . . local omggg . usually love the direction and theme of these but the execution and script are rubbish
last got a movie leak story mat kilau full movie looks like it looks like
People say that Mat Kilau movie is bad because of bad script . But I didn't expect it was actually REALLY BAD The characters don't have realistic conversations . They just throw 'big quotes' on every chance they get . Like a coffee chat to fight who can say the 'wokest'
His movies are rubbish . You idiots are quickly impressed with Mat
"In terms of history and heritage , there seems to be no promotion while Pahang could have ride on the Mat Kilau movie and sell Kg Pulau Tawar as a tourism object . Sell Ulu Cheka via Pawang Noh a lesser known legend . There is a Pawang Noh Gallery in Ulu Cheka that is not on the tourism"
"Some kuning likes to make plots , Raja Abdullah for example . The regiment may be a plot just like how Javanese joined Heiho during Jp occupation there , then used the combat skills to fight against imperialists . But watching Mat Kilau movie followed by Lt . Adnan movie is just"
"I looked at tiktok and suddenly came out after the syamsul/aaron mess . Haha , having watched syamsul's movies , I think he's suitable for gangsters . I was madly disappointed that day . His narration is beautiful . But oh God , his cinematography is ruined . I want to see"
"I doubt she would be as successful as she is now even if she got full support . Malaysia's market power is too low compared to Hong Kong and Hollywood . Just look Mat Kilau , highest grossing but only 97 mil ringgit far cry from the most mediocre direct to cd Disney movies"
"I think EEAAO is also a story that if a fan of the Mat Kilau movie sees , he will not understand and will not"
"please differentiate between soap operas and movies , and what is the difference between malay moves better? the fact is that msians movies are still far below the level of indo , mat kilaua which was boasted in the past is even equivalent to the quality of indo years"
Imaginary . One of the movies I couldn't sleep this year . Solid like the second Malay story I didn't sleep after the luster . Maybe Beto Kusyairi's and Diana Danielle's acting will be right . I can't sleep because everything is a problem and unpredictable . 
Yes . . . . I think so too he is protecting his money and other assets . . . . his Mat Kilau movie which he directed made RM 100 million in the box office
"It's nice to know that the movie is the best and is there any content? After leaving the movie , you feel like watching it again . make me feel like that . Mat Kilau makes me want to refund my money & time . "
"The film industry here wants to win an Oscar at the Academy Awards so bad but when you send a mediocre (personally IMO , really badly made) movie like Mat Kilau as a contender , I feel like there is no"
Mat Kilau . There is no historical story . Letop2 can box office . It seems that Malaysians like this type of movie
"Some people say that Anwar's untold story is not to be believed because there may be additions to make the story more beautiful . that's the end of the Mat Kilau story , that's very true . just relax both of them"
The target market of this story is not just Malaysia . Production is also from Indonesia . Want to compare with Mat Kilau is not relevant . The movie is Action/Drama . Not biographical
I watched mat kilau at the movies and that one sucked ass . Was playing with my phone the whole time . But imaginur is good not bcs it stands out from the other local movies . It genuinely has a good storyline and cinematography . It deserves a praise . Of course it's not
if you want to compare with random Malaysian movies: Sa Balik Baju is far and away the best Bunohan is far and away the best Chow Kit is the best KL Gangster is far and away the best Mat Kilau not sure Istanbul here i come! by far the best (peak Beto
"Listen to the story , this movie IMAM wants to fight Mat Kilau's narrative . But with many comments , people say the quality is far from heaven and earth (Mat Kilau more power) So , you have to see it to find out"
Why is it that Imaginur's story doesn't get Mat Kilau's response? Malaysians like movies that are simple and don't have to think a lot
They allowed all those twisted stories/narratives to scare people using racial lines and this is the consequence . Eg Mat Kilau
"Malay: some random Hooligan: Why don't Malays take care of their own culture and throw it away for the sake of religion? Malay: make a Mat Kilau movie , do it as an effort to preserve culture Hooligans: FASCIST , RACIST , FACIST FACIST , RACIST"
"I like the hype for wahid/beto after mat kilau movie , like moon bintang and pakmat western"
"Who likes the movie Mat Kilau , our movie tastes are not the same . Even the tallest one is 5/10 . The script is messy , the plot is lame , the story line is too much , the actors are the best . The acting is solid , it's a pity that it's like that . "
Beto stole the movie more than Mat Kilau
"Done watching Air Force the movie , sis cried when Adnan died . . sobs . . this is the best story . . compared to Mat Kilau , I feel a lot different from this Air Force , Mat Kilau is normal , this Air Force made me neves , crying , angry and scared . . "
"Each time there is an intense scene , it feels like torture , it feels like your brain is shaking like you don't see mv Mat Kilau , but this is literally brain shaking! Can't wait to see the movie"
"Basically , Mat Kilau films are bad , just look at the reviews on movie forums . If the quality is bad , it's obvious that it's the same as the Indo market . . "
"Mat kilau could have been better that said is a damn good movie la , its like braveheart effect after watching it you will hate the colonials all . its not for everyone . I think the best movies so far I've watched recently was goodwill hunting on"
I remember Mat Kilau's story . . . I started a verbal war cursing non-Malays . . . non-Malays didn't watch the movie . . . didn't like the behavior
It's good that the story is broken at the box office . I don't see my brother's brother wearing a woman's cloth inside
what's going on in this movie? Do you remember that there is only 1 genre of movies like Mat Kilau? make a story about hackers with more power than this softporn movie . those who do it are not Malay like me . there are Malays who do that
did anyone complain about paskal and Mat Kilau? those 2 movies are great level movies . people just feel annoyed by too much sexual attraction in this movie rather than
"Never liked his movies . I've only seen one , Mat Kilau (only for Beto Kusyairy) I hate it when the men keep saying ""lu gua lu gua"" . It's true that I directly taught you . . All time banned from me"
"Bro , you see that Indonesia has movies now that are at the international level . You look at it from a different angle . It's like a special movement that looks very acting . because it looks real . Mat Kilau for me 3/5 sb like the communist idiots use weapons they can attack tgh2 the field run straight you won't die"
"Me joining the hype: Never watch Mat Kilau . Even when it's on Netflix . Not because of him . Because no longer feeling the need to watch movies anymore . Used to be a movie fan , a fan of the latest movies . Now? I'd rather"
"Rarely watch his movie too , if not mistaken ""Mat Kilau"" either produced or directed by him and he's the son of Yusof Haslam , a veteran actor in Malaysian movie industry . . . dare not to register marriage here? Haha , why not if it's in accordance with sharia law and"
I'm the only one who feels sorry for going to the cinema to see a Mat Kilau film . you
"Mat Kilau is the last movie I watched , but I still cite the OG . I've been waiting for a long time because it's the best actor , but the director is a doi la sol . . it really breaks your heart"
Sorry if women's emotions are disturbed but definitely no more Sol's movie in my list . Even Mat Kilau I don't see anymore . I do not know . Don't do that to your wife . Hopefully
"Just watched the movie J2: J Retribution . Best , good storyline and action . Good quality for Malaysia standard . Much better than Matt"
"Still haven't watched Mat Kilau . The passion for the costume and the true intention of the movie being published will never go away . It's a mistake , I didn't get there"
"The quality of the movie is totally out and out , both in terms of sound and camera work , it's best because it's a historical movie , it's different"
"That day I just saw Qodrat . It's not the best , even if you already know the story line , it's like copying and pasting the story of Munafik , but it's ok . Indon has more interesting movies now . The important thing is that the camera is not dull like a Mat Kilau . Eh"
There is no descendants of meleis dajjal in the Indonesian government btw meleis music on spotify indon also when will it enter the top 50????? When will the movie meleis go forward? Movie Mat Kilau like controversy wkwkwkwk that's at least 1 and
"Pegiweiii . . it's so amazing that Malaysia can make animation details like that . The plot is normal . . because it's like a pinch of Marvel , a bit of DC , a bit of Kingsman , a bit of Mat Kilau . If you are interested in watching this , you can immediately spot this scene from this movie . . "
"Actually , you don't even have to wait for the ""movie reviewer"" to review the movie for you to see that one story . Reviewers have their own biases . Movie rating is actually personal for raters . What that person likes is not necessarily what you like . But Mat Kilau is not the best (I've never watched"
"Yes , but the situation of these two movies is quite different . Mat Klaau is viral because it has a historical connection , so many smart people are smart enough to take the port because they can talk about it (also because of SY) . Mechamato doesn't have much to talk about for going viral like MK other than it's a successful Monsta product"
"""Hawa likes the History Subject after watching the Movie Mat Kilau"" . . ""Hajar likes history after mom tells stories from the 80s"" Camner wants to give children who like Math"
i know some fans kept saying its fictional and not meant to be historically accurate THEN WHY EVEN MAKE
Imagine if the mechamato movie came out at the same time as the Mat Kilau story . The power tho!! There are more and more people going uphill to fight
Remember the people who complained about the Mat Kilau movie fighting scene . Got slapped but the sound effect is like shit . Hello? Have you never seen a Tamil/Hindustan versus Tamil/Hindustan movie?? The best coat!! The sound goes first before the fist arrives . I just want to complete Mat
You know how distasteful the local movie industry is when Adi Putra (from Mat Kilau) wins best actor award at
"Lol im just telling from a different perspective , for example mat kilau - how accurate is it? Or even hollywood movie black hawk down . . im not saying ur wrong , its just different"
"Kilau would hv been a wonderful movie with a correct historical narrative if the film producer , director & writer didn't throw minorities under the bus to sell an"
Mat Kilau the most overrated movie ever in Malaysia . The most annoying for me is the sound effect plus the camera shaking . Is there an earthquake during the shooting? The sound effect is not realistic . I want to copy Ip Man but it doesn't work . 
Learn history from the movie Mat Kilau? Almost everything in the movie is factually wrong and messed up . Its a fictional movie btw . It's when you sleep in History class that you don't even know the federal constitution
"On tiktok , there is a video showing the flag , but the audio of Adi Putera is in the Mat Kilau movie . Those who agree with that video still want to live in the same place"
"I don't know why , I miss Yasmin Ahmad and her film . Detoxing myself with her movie after just a brief moment with Mat Kilau . We need an inclusive story that shows true Malaysian spirit and"
"Nice story , the film is not historically correct . And then make Malays feel inferior"
"I don't like Mat Kilau movies , it's not because of the racism issue . . But the movie is really not the best . The first 10 minutes I didn't feel like going out"
"Wei , why arrest Muyi and others , also the Mat Kilau movie director . Because he is a person , this is all happening . Arrst them under the Act"
The one who chatted and looked at this Mat Kilau made me feel bad . Do not read the history of that luster other than
"honestly , I've never seen Mat Kilau's story ahhaha so I'm clueless as to what this tiktok boy is talking about Mat Kilau's movie"
"I don't see Mat Kilau is a racist movie . If you study history properly , you will know . Young generation these days really don't seem to 'research' it rather than saying 'OMG THIS MOVIE IS RACIST . DON'T WATCH"
"Yes , it's wrong , if people campaign in a healthy way and don't raise religious sentiments , won't young people be so influenced that they want to say that people don't like Mat Kilau movies , right? People who are blind to the history of people who know the movie are dull"
"Because of Mat Kilau's story , do you have Malay blood? Lanciao , if the movie doesn't come out , it would be nice before this multi-racial hiduo . It's been decades since independence"
"""the spirit of luster!!"" they had ONE song playing the entire movie and its best described as Epic Background Music pls don't get any idea from that"
I can't blame the Mat Kilaute film tbh . bc it's relevant to that point of time . Malays were really struggling back then . don't nitpick history for your own
"Chat against people who watch Mat Kilau but vote for PH . Mat Kilau is against the colonialists . Ah fool! You know Mat Kilau from the movie , you didn't study history"
"Movies like Mat Kilau shown to younger audiences (below 18) should be prohibited , when you are not mentally able to make sound decisions , we could see a bunch of hooligans running around stabbing and chopping"
"That's what makes me angry . Talk about history because you learn from TikTok , as far as watching Mat Kilau movie while at school you sleep during class"
"But the Mat Kilau story is really funny , I just watched it . It's like 10 times I've been amused by movie mat"
"The previous Govt ruling should also be blamed . They should have banned Mat Kilau (movie) , which is in no way historically accurate & glorifies racial separation while portraying one race as superior & dominant . The makers should be fined heavily for trying to incite race based"
"Over and over again , there are movies with Mat Kilau , it's just the characters that are repeated over and over again . Because I don't even know history myself , right? Just say what is there as long as it looks like it is there"
"Next time watching the movie once is enough . The 3-4 times you look at that Mat Kilau , it's really a shot to your brain , even your brother's brother is dizzy , BN is falling , and you're getting dizzy"
"I saw a tiktok saying ""those who voted for ph can watch the movie again with Mat Kilau coat"" BRO THAT MOVIE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE"
Suddenly I feel like blaming Syamsul Yusof for the direction of the movie Mat Kilau when I see Tiktok of a young boy about May 13
"And to those who use mat kilau movie as a good example , yall should really learn history with books , not"
I don't know if you watch the movie Mat Kilau and you become Malay . You are stupid because the movie is full of distorted facts . Just fiction . It's time for your History class
"All those tiktok videos that are funny mention the movie Mat Kilau . Not the character , but the movie . Now tell me that movie wasn't an effective propaganda piece . PN should give Syamsul Yusuf some sort of"
"In my opinion , Mat kilau makes a story that catalyzes the spirit of warriors , Le . If it is the catalyst of the nation , aduuuu . Struggle alone . In fact , a movie should not be made to awaken children's souls"
"History has proven the fall of the Malay land because there is no unity among us , some defected but unfortunately we never want to learn from our nation's old mistakes . Watched the Mat Kilau movie many times but didn't learn the lesson . It's hard , isn't it?"
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
"My aunt wants to say that she is not Muslim but she wears a hijab , she wants to say that she is full but she is old , remember , auntie , don't be a traitor to your own religion , when you watch the movie , you will feel the identity of the Malay nation until you see it in the movie , when you are 15 all done"
"Right?? In terms of culture , elements of Sume's indigenization are indeed crowned with the highest Muslims can learn a lot from this movie Even Mat Kilau"
"I remember there was a movie reviewer who discussed the Malaysian demographics affecting the collection of movies . At that time , people were talking about RM 30 million as the most they could get if you take into account the audience factor on Earth . Hopefully Mat Kilau's story will attract a non-Earthly audience"
just pure arrogance Mat Kilau movie had cemented into the mainstream . Many Malays now feel comfortable showing theirs
I just saw Dahmer and I'm feeling nauseous . . it's not yet Eid gain and it's a movie . I don't see the Mat Kilau
"Fake account? Check back , I have this account since when . X main r fake2 . The court case was not settled because my boss wanted to prove that he was guilty . That's it . Very jealous of people . How is our nation going to progress? It doesn't look like a shelf . I don't feel the spicy sarcasm in the movie . Thick"

"This is why I can't believe any Malay film critics who praise Mat Kilau because to me the story is rubbish . Trash . It's stories like this that make people go back to ""I don't watch Malay movies"" . Because he was appointed as the greatest , he is actually very humble . Then u complain org x"
"The more I think about the movie adaptation of history Mat Kilau , the worst it gets . Why the fuck did I give it a 5? I'm changing it to a 2 because it gets worse when I think about it"
"2 . Since only Whites are referred with ""Sir"" which means ""Mister"" by most of malays nowadays , it doesn't Mat Kilaur to say that Mat Kilau movie is totally nothing more than a useless history documentation in cinemas . They should refer to them as ""mister"" (encik) , no more ""sir"""
"ISMA boys don't make Mat Kilau script , top 10 International most watch netflix . Best blockbuster movie in Malaysian cinema"
Just watch Mat Kilau . It's so good . I need more malay movies with this history
"Hahaha , I think race is fine , religion we need to have vast knowledge in order to have a debate or argument over it , politics are quite tricky but if its super obvious like najib & rosmah , we should talk about it , mat kilau is average movie quality with overhype"
Just finished matt movie Mat Kilau . . Script 9/10 Cinematography 4/10 Summary its like watching 100 scenes in ten
"It's the same as Malay movies . For example , the movie Mat Kilau . The actors are all there"
"Mat kilau movie is pretty disappointing , story n fight choreography is good , but the composition n camera is ????"
"3 . Mat Kilau It's a story of the British colonial reign in India and how they were repelled . It is also an average movie , expect some of the Bollywood action sh*t . It's 5 . 3/10 for"
ok but am the only one who got impressed by how creative our brain is at constructing dreams? like the plot fuh impressive? better than that mat kilau movie tho i dont actually watch the
"When I got home , I saw that mom and dad were watching the movie , ready to turn off the lights . . feeling at the cinema"
Why the heck does the sentence 'mat kilau'd all over the enemy' sound better than the actual
"Brother , the luster of the nation's fighters? Do you know that before he was with Dato Bahaman against the British near Pahang , he was in the Klang war , the Klang war , it was a civil war to fight for tin ore , bro , learn more history instead of watching Mat Kilau movies by being fed with"
"This movie definitely has better character building and storytelling than Mat Kilau . But action-wise , Mat Kilau wins . But then again , their movie genres are slightly different . But the main theme and message are"
"Tried my best to be neutral , enjoy the movie and to really feel the patriotism . But the emotion is just too much . All prominent actors , overshadowing each other , Mat Kilau's aura is not really"
"Go back and put it on Mat Kilau's story , watch the scale with the children . The story doesn't end anymore , everyone is fighting in front of the TV . In the end , I don't even understand what this story is about . Busy with people all the time"
"Bruh , I've seen much crude , sadistic jokes by Western satirists Fahmi Reza's dig on the Mat Kilau actor pales in comparison It's hilarious u'r tryin 2 frame a rich movie star being ""bullied"" by a street artist whose source of income is crowdfunding via"
"If I feel that way , don't go to Twitter to criticize how bad the movie is . "
It's not political propaganda i hate mat kilau film also because the quality as a movie i grow up watching bllywood and tllywood every friday n sunday most of the time villain is muslim we don't condemn it's as racist it just a movie even do we know Muslim in India is
Mat kilau is very bad quality movie but if you say it's a racial movie then you have some mental problem everytime i watch bollywood and tamil movie on friday and sunday almost everytime the villain is muslim but we ok with it 4 me it just movie you trying to politicize
"I'm sorry but Mat Kilau is one of the worst Malaysian movies I've ever seen . In terms of technical of course it looks great and the shots are nice but at the end of the day , if it's bad storytelling , it's still a bad movie"
"The tastes of Malaysians are diverse , just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . The story is ok , the actors are ok , overall all is ok . For me , Mat Kilau has no flaws and a story to enjoy . Movies are made for everyone to enjoy . Tears were shed when Rokiah was hit"
Me and my girls watched Mat Kilau for the first few minutes and then we changed it to something else . Not because the movie was bad . . but those kids getting shot was just too
"thoughts on Mat Kilau 1 . it has everything that i absolutely hate in a syamsul yusof movie (TERRIBLE sound mixing , migraine inducing shaky camera , annoying timing for slow motions and zoom ins) there r some neat shots tho 2 . fight choreography was cool 3 . "
i didnt have any expectations for abang long fadil 3 so it was an average movie for me but the cinematography and camera work for the actions are better than some (mat
"All the noise about Mat Kilau , sis , I want to share it . Just watch it once , it's ok if you want to repeat it . This movie reminds me of special moves + hypocrisy hmm eeeii I'm not good at reviewing movies"
I don't understand why some Malays are unable to understand Mat Kilau movie deeply . Some of them believed we should againts opposition nowadays but infact we should unite againts the Malay government that we have now This is a clear and accurate description down to the hole
Mat Kilau on Netflix seems like a different experience compared to watching in theater . Watching it in theater the speaker is so loud and loud and loud but in netflix it feels like a normal sound
"But the script , plot , the cinematography , the camera work etc . Its just not that good as how ppl make it sounds like . Cause honestly , this aint the first malaysian movie with such historical theme but im pretty sure i can name few old movie that is way better than mat"
"That's syamsul yusof , why did he get the script , the movie became a commercial success because of the legendary name , if it wasn't for Mat Kilau , already"
"One of the strong parts from the movie Mat Kilau is the story that he never gets bored . Even there are a lot of significant dialog and technical problems , but it's a good start to produce a local historical movie that doesn't get boring even if other historical movies are technically good . That's why there are two types"
"Duh , the one who just saw Mat Kilau is so tired to complain . Look at it . Just enjoy the movie . The name is also 'inspired' by historical stories . It's just a story . Nervous"
Just watched Mat Kilau and can't brain how few Malay nation failed to acknowledge the history . Forget your cinematography it is still watchable and educational . Without the movie I doubt they would read on Mat
"really good comment about Mat Kilau , even though its not a good enough explain the history , you should respect their effort for making that"
"Eee , how is tiber siott . . how did he turn to malay . . when did he argue about the history of malay people . . he just commented about the movie instead of the Mat Kilau itself . . please don't embarrass yourself here . . you really lack on reading comprehension . . a lot of reading"
"I've seen Mat Kilau on nexflix . Overall it is a good movie . Even though some people say that the script is boring , if you really understand the meaning behind the script , you will understand . It's normal that people are not the same . I don't blame them . Everyone has an opinion"
Okay but what type of dialogue that you guys expect for Mat Kilau huh i dont understand this folks and i saw some that waiting for a big plot what??? Comeon its a historical movie . . . . if you want to watch it then watch it if you are not interested then
I'm really lazy to watch the power comment about the Mat Kilau movie . I don't even know what you expect in the story
"Done look at Mat Kilau . Fast storyline . Malay clothes are not worn , they should be worn before they are real . the movie filter is too bright . The character & impact of Wahid (Beto)— makes Mat Kilau's story more palatable . "
"Those who have watched mat kilau on Netflix , then there are those who are not satisfied , why don't you be like that . . if you want to be satisfied , watch the movie . . that's the right feeling , watch mat kilau . . I've watched it 4 times already I want to see it again but later"
"I rarely go crazy watching Malay movies . I love romance movies and malay romance cringe crazy usually . I saw Mat Kilau's story at the cinema that day . Honestly , I'd watch the movie over and over again . I admit Kilau's character does not need to be very serious to the point he looks"
"It's true what they said in the movie Mat Kilau , you can think it's just a story to entertain but take it so seriously that every day you want"
5 minutes early . . . Mat Kilau . . *sound effect Mat Kilau like you see in Dragon Ball . . * change another movie
"I'm ok with the movie Mat Kilau , only if the opponents act like KL Gangster . Just make it normal . But because the market here likes rival stories , the heavy biography genre is how well it sells"
"I want to talk about Mat Kilau . That movie is an over-budget theater performance that lacks depth and plot . I also want to talk about Abang Long Fadil 3 . That movie was fun , silly and beautiful"
"Hahaha , it seems that after watching the movie , you didn't read the real history of Mat Kilau . So please shut up . Because the more you sound the more you appear to be one of the people who failed the history subject first . *I've seen the movie and it's still a failure"
"Watch the movie PUTERI GUNUNG LEDANG . big gap from Mat Kilau . The type of images , the style of conversation , the way the story is told . . . the difference . . 2004 vs 2022 , the difference between the 2004 film and the 5"
"Dude can't even tell how criticism works like then we say that mostly people condemn the scripts and how to record videos , it has nothing to do with the budget . No one talks about the budget . If you think Mat kilau can be better , give your suggestion to make the movie even"
Mat Kilau as a movie yes But the real history of the man is not an insult Malay Culture=/Malay
"im malay Maybe more Malay than you or the rest . But I will never watch Mat Kilau because 1 . Just another shitty movie . 2 . Actor Adi Putra is hardcore UMNO ass licker 3 . This is a propaganda film . 4 . With ticket sales 100m , show how fuxxed up malay"
"Compared to movies in the country , there is still a lot of shortages , Merongmahawangsa , Lieutenant Adnan , Bukit Kepong , he has cinematography , dialogue and storyline that are not brilliant but we as viewers are not bored watching and enjoy the movie"
As history movie lover I'm approved Mat Kilau . Sis
"Just watching Mat Kilau . Very cool movie , it is easy to understand and talk about . Definitely not for starbucks folks , but for teh tarik drinkers this is some topic and maybe a start to you know , way to move forward . We are too comfortable to appreciate it"
"It's good to make a trap in the forest , suddenly the British can come out recklessly like that . I feel angry when I watch Mat Kilau movies"
"Mat Kilau is fucking ass . The cast , script , production , sound effects , etc . But at least our Malay friends finally have a local superhero movie for themselves . Not surprised why they're all"
He clearly said that the movie is fiction and inspired by Mat Kilau . What kind of history is it if from start to finish you fight by talking without looking at the camera
"It's like Netflix has a Mat Kilau story . If you don't like it , watch another movie . What's your IP?"
What do you do when it feels like nothing else can be watched on Netflix? Not Mat Kilau movie . 
"The script is so cringe , so funny as the talk . I patted my head the most when the part of the British colonists had a lecture about the weakness of the Malays in front of the mat kilau when they were first attacked by the tuyuk , what are the British in the movie?"
Done look at Mat Kilau . His story is not bad . Camera shaking? That's because the scene is suspended indeed . You will find a lot of shaking cameras in any action scene movie . It's in the Avengers too
"why don't the people who judge the Mat Kilau movie really relax , you tell the story of a bored omputih , you don't want to judge 14 days and 14 nights . This story has been going on for a long time , why are you up again? triggered because of many support and"
"I just saw the Mat Kilau before I think the movie is ok . A movie about Malay history , right? History is like that , it can be changed at will . What you want to show is"
"I don't like Mat Kilau's story , pro colonialists say If you like Mat Kilau's story , he says that we have a bad taste in movies Enough"
"The feeling of watching Mat Kilau at the cinema is different if you compare it to Netflix . At the movie , I feel like it's not bad . When I look back on Netflix , it feels like a movie trash"
"The Mat Kilau is bad . Story line , fight scene , script / dialogue are too corny . Can the 100 million be scammed? It was too hard to watch after 30 minutes into it . Was laughing and cringing throughout the movie . There are lots of great malay movies . This aunt"
"Mat Kilau is , without a doubt , a horrible movie . Individuals who enjoy it have a low standard for film quality . That concludes the"
"Even watching Netflix is paid , but in Netflix there is not only Mat Kilau , there are many other movies . . if you don't want to watch , you can watch other movies , if it's a legitimate movie , we only pay to watch that story . . so the tweeter said watch I understand the meaning of Netflix free"
"Why did many people hit the Mat Kilau after it was shown on netflix? Was it the greatest movie on earth? Definitely no . But I did enjoy it despite the plot that was so meh . Maybe the experience at the movie theater and TV is different , but at the movie theater , it's in the right mood . "
"He's like you are a fan of Thor movies . I'm a fan of Mat Kilau stories . When a lot of people curse on Twitter about Thor's story , do you get angry? ""Thor is the worst movie I've even seen . . "" like that . Like what they did to Mat Kilau . And not for a full explanation . I'm more interested in the story line"
"I'm angry . Because I think the story of Thor Thunder & Love is not the best , I will not curse on Twitter . But , when it's a Malay story . . it doesn't Mat Kilau . You will judge . . it's not fair , right? Judge is the worst movie . But don't even explain"
"It's enough if you want to make all logical movies . Even the name is fiction . If the soldier shoots at one time , the movie is only 15 minutes long . It became a short film . Fighting scene over so much? Part of it sounds , but imagine kicking without sound , it looks like action"
"The problem is correct . If it's a hollywood story , release the same scene as in the Mat Kilau . This tribe does not want to condemn . When it's a Malay movie , you quickly tweet all the things you don't like , and you're happy to say that Malays can't be touched , so you're weak because you want to insult Malays . "
"Why are so many people suddenly arguing over Mat Kilau? I still think it was a fantastic movie , I don't care what other people say . When a movie manages to make you feel strongly emotional about something , for me it is a definite success , despite its probable"
"why are peoples in twitter are so pressed about Mat Kilau movie? the cinematic was great , the sound and so on , what do you guys want? chat about dialogue , what do you want to get into? just enjoy the movie , don't like to be silent . you guys tweeting shits here again bringing down the industry"
"Mat Kilau is great for debates even on the storyboard , there are people chatting who say what movie is there sb . Well , sadly , not all of them are in Msia , bro . Haha but a good director always has their own notes on his script . If it's like kabir , he makes a ready shot list for every scene in the script"
"Repeat after me . . ""MAT KILAU IS NOT A HISTORY MOVIE . "
"Who is interested in watching Mat Kilau movie , don't force people who are not interested to be interested . Those who are not interested in watching Mat Kilau , don't force interested people not to be interested . That's just a story for me . Designed and created for film . Some like it , some don't like it . "
"for me . . it's the best thing . . I didn't see it at the movie , I still feel it . . then twice I saw it on netflix . . for me , its ok . . where is the perfect movie . we as humans are not perfect , this is a movie . Historical movies are boring . over ja malaysian netizens"
"At first , I didn't see the Mat Kilau at GSC , it's strange why the language is not right , but when you think about the logic of the spa language , you still want to use it for movies , you want to use b . baku , it's illegal for people to understand , right? I want to read the subs , I want to feel the scenes again . . I just got it . . Last , if you want to make a whole movie , use that language"
"Now you won't believe how much American Political Agenda was shot in that movie but the story is pretty much shit through and through . The reason for its success is simple , Giant Transforming Robots Fight Each Other . Same goes with Matt"
Gosh!! I can't stand it . . . I feel nauseous and continue to breastfeed my child while watching a movie
"most malaysians rn: you're sick of criticizing Mat Kilau movies! * okay , have fun watching shit movie quality in the next 10 years . while other countries already have a 'recipe' for certain types of movies . It's not , the story of history is like watching a special movement"
Great actor with great skills . Just often time with bad scripts and bad directors . Like I said . Bad movies = Mat Kilau is one of them . Bad performance = None in my
"We don't condemn Mat Kilau films for nothing , but for the people in the industry to improve their products because we want to make high quality films which our neighbors Thailand and Indonesia have been doing for the past 15-20 years . Please learn , won't you?"
It's a good feeling to watch a Mat Kilau movie with another netflix . That's why a lot of people say it's not the best when watching netflix Mat Kilau movies
It's noisier than this Mat Kilau movie . It sounds the same over and over again . . not appetizing to the
Mat kilau is a decent movie but the sound effect wow
"The best thing is what's bad , even if it's bad , at least this Mat Kilau can come to teaching , then it's easy for students to understand history instead of reading and memorizing from textbooks . Those who feel bad go make movies"
"Every line in the script is like a religious/political talk . His action scene is ok . At this stage , the Msia audience says it's the best? A lot of people say don't compare with Hollywood , Bollywood etc etc but shouldn't we compare with the best so that we can improve? Mat Kilau"
"I don't know . Mat Kilau stays 9/10 . One of the best movies that has been brilliant for me . With the actors & sentences that were thrown all A+ & hit my soul . Other people want to curse , curse . But Don't ""Insult"""
"My mom reacted to the Mat Kilau movie: The story is okay , I enjoyed watching it . But the opponent's part , the camera is terrible . For me , I am like my mom . It's also fun to watch"
I want to curse the movie Mat Kilau . Don't curse Beto Kusyairy . I fought until the end
I don't want to defend and condemn more fictional movies whose characters are just coincidences with history . Fictional . Rekaan . We should not even care if Mat Kilau is wearing a superman shirt riding a dinosaur against the British while singing a song
It's also funny the fanatics who can't see people commenting on the Mat Kilau movie like this movie determines Malay sovereignty . Technical critics and pushy scripts . Each POV . Do you want a story that lifts silat and the script is okay but the budget is way lower but a good movie? My take is
"okay , just finished looking at the Mat Kilau . the movie was good 7/10 . if I'm syamsul yusof's sister , it's best to be able to comment on where to touch up for the audience to get what they want when watching a movie"
Wehh what people hype is so dull ehh i just watched it and I don't understand what makes people hype it that much . It's a great movie tho but gosh the acting is
"Match the emotional hang name lol . That day , Zhaf cursed the yellow girl , you said it was her right as a ticket-paying audience to comment on the movie , what's the point of criticizing it , she insulted me even more . I'm criticizing and getting criticized by Mat Kilau fans . Hypocrite"
"It's fun to curse the movie Mat Kilau . I'm quite happy that someone is willing to make a movie about a historical figure , not an influencer , a drug kingpin who speaks Malay plates , a rich family who wants to pay for it , a slapstick comedy that has no direction"
"As a movie lover , I hope the government does not sponsor historical movies and give exclusive contracts to Syamsul Yusuf . He's good but not good enough . Movie Mat Kilau was a disappointment . The good things about that movie are the actors , props , n choreography (excluding camera"
"To me the movie Mat Kilau is okay . Nothing to hate on . Lines are a bit cheesy tho . Color grading was off in some shots . Cameraworks is a little bad , not much . Tears were"
"why are people suddenly condemning this Mat Kilau movie? i watched it on cinema n i enjoyed it . it feels like it straight coming out of history textbook + the ending is ""tergantung"" i heard from somewhere that the actual Mat Kilau ran away after they won the fight? idk maybe tht was the"
Decided to give Mat Kilau a chance . Waste of 30 minutes of my time that I can't get back . Wooden acting with poor cinematography . Even the action sequences from the 80's movies are better . Just lazy writing with poor
"Personally , I don't like watching movies and TV shows . But I like the sentiment of the Mat Kilau story that brings the spirit of Malay identity and other noble values . I like to see a lot of happy families together , use the ramp to see , young people have the passion to know history , interest"
"mat kilau's story (not the movie) is inspirational and should've been done right in the movie , bcs i am not feeling the malay propaganda in this"
"because I already know the story line & the sound at my house is not as good as in the movie . I will never watch a movie that I didn't understand the first time . I watched it again just once . I think it's best because I already know the storyline & I like it because I understand it , but it's upside down , people don't"
Why are the gangs of gangs who are angry about Mat Kilau being criticized? Are you the one who benefits from this movie or do you feel that the dignity of your nation and country is being challenged? Criticism This can be used as a step to further improve the level of our film industry . We already know there is potential
"This Mat Kilau story can be a type of investigative film . Detective movie . Find out who is the defector of Malay officials . At the end , Mat Kilau seems to have sacrificed himself for Pahang's victory , but the final scene shows him living in the forest . The black shirt with the raspy voice is there , all that's left is the mask . . . "
"Casting for omputeh roles is inexplicably bad . WTF . Sikh soldiers are portrayed as one-dimensional sadists . Mat Kilau is political propaganda wrapped in a morality play — given the movie's cultural impact , a longer essay on this might be"
"Hahaha every month he subscribes not just to watch one story , not Mat Kilau but the movie on Netflix . I don't even have netflix free . But when you think about it , people want to wait for Netflix because they want to chill and save money"
"I've seen Mat Kilau near Netflix . How can they collect hundreds of millions of ringgit when the quality of the soap opera story is better than this movie . Oh yes forget , who saw all the Palawans climbing the Malay Nazi Supremacy . Bani's life"
Watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . For me the main weakness of the movie is that it did not do a good job in telling the history of Mat Kilau . It feels like a generic silat movie set during the British occupation . Who is Mat Kilau? How did he become a
Too much cinematography and character development critics for Mat Kilau movie . But for me just enjoy the movie . Just chill
"Have your own opinion . . about this Mat Kilau . . at least there is anger towards the colonialists . . that's good enough . . sometimes these tribes are one thing more than foreign movies . . littered with stories about movies . . for me , Malaysians rarely do factual stories . . want to ask to read history , kaji . jauh . . read a novel"
"Why do many people say Mat Kilau's story is bad/give a bad rating? That's why before this , why can the movie explode?"
"Well for me . . from the point of view of the movement of the camera in Mat Kilau , it is less like a Hollywood action movie . . . but I appreciate the script in that movie more . . how are the characteristics of the Malays that cause the invasion of colonists , consumed by incitement and influence"
"Can't compare with anything . The movie itself is cringe , more action but shakes here and there , the sound doesn't match the action shown . If the Mat Kilau is good for you , I guess that's your standard of 'a good movie'"
I've seen Mat Kilau on netflix already . Syamsul Yusuf's typical action movie . I'm so bored that I don't feel like commenting . 
"I see the best . Your mind is narrow to make a comparison with Hollywood , it's really different , people with a budget of ten million . Matt kilau is a movie about history , where can you turn it away like an action or sci-fi movie , you expect"
"Also , the one who made Cite Mat Kilau is Syamsul Yusof , one of the best movie authors in Malaysia . If the movie he made is a lot of complaints , let alone another author who produced the story . Anyway , it's ok , at least there is a story that shows about history"
"Well said mate! I'm not a fan of history , but because the movie Mat Kilau has an exhaustive chapter on the history of Mat Kilau , I'm looking for reading sources . He has that effect , I can feel it baby . That's for me , to get distracted by other movies"
"Sept 18 , 2022 - I haven't seen Mat Kilau yet , no movies & no Netflix . Anyone who has seen it , understands that it is a movie , not the History Channel . So there is a little adjustment , so chill . . just enjoy it"
"Haven't watched Mat Kilau . Had a chance to see the Air Force . It's not the kind of diligent to watch movies actually , but people invite us onz . Usually had time to sleep in there But watching AirForce that day , I didn't even feel sleepy . Luck"
"Its an adaptation based on what actually happened , of course some modifications were made . The two scenes practically made the whole movie bro . Mat kilau is a real figure and how he was depicted fits his description in history , whether you like it or not"
"It's as if he opened a Mat Kilau movie just to contrast with the one he saw on the stage before , he just wants to say the Mat Kilau Mat Kilau story is bad , low iq , shaky camera , only for Malay , only 10 minutes"
Remember we have moved on from Mat Kilau when the movie release near the cinema . Now we're all back to square one
"That day someone asked for an opinion on which Mat Kilau with Air Force is the best . I said it , air force . . He should have started a long description that is Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau , it's the best blah blah blah Duh , I just like watching movies . . It's rare to judge from the cinematography , background music , camera , etc . "
"It's not like that . Don't judge people like that . For me , I feel crazy and strange when I read the replies in this thread that are all about Mat Kilau . . Just enjoy it , just watch the movie"
"no body love british or hating mat kilau himself , we know ckp psl quality movie n tk fhm why ppl bashing like become apostate if ckp this movie is normal , over betul dh become level if rajnikanth's character dies on stage kna"
"Movie reviewer Malay in 2023 be like: ""For me , Mat Kilau is not the best , the dialogue feels unnatural and there are many scenes where the camera shakes very badly . So my rating"
"I just want to appreciate Mat Kilau just as it is . A movie with great fighting scenes . You can see the effort from importing outside actors . The historically part is the last thing I want to comment on . As compem cincai . As a script writer , I don't want to highlight it I have a lot of speeches"
"Maybe for bro this movie is a popcorn movie . But maybe there are a few who take it as knowledge . Because there are people who start to discover the original story of psl heroes mat kilau and other heroes . Ok what . . ""I mean a few , you know . Not"
"I don't know why you want to defend the Mat Kilau movie so much , the quality is not equal , the standard of SY has that movie , he is good at trying new things & has a strong influence in commercial but the movie does not depict the real atmosphere of Mat Kilau"
"Yes correct . But please make the story of the prophet and make it a historical fiction movie . That's what I don't agree with . Ni Kisah mat kilau Beb: Even though it's big , it's not the same . But there is also input , right: psl silat psl religion psl war with colonialists . So we take it as good input"
"Saying Mat Kilau a bad movie not going to make you cool . . . And I am not cool . . . Eye candy from the style frame but not in actual footage and it the movie is forcing too much . To be honest , most of the movies by Samsul have a cringy script . I felt funny rather than"
"yes its in bad taste to say about audience has iq . we critique mainly the storytelling like low iq meaning no complexity in characters arcs , so you can shut down ur brain and enjoy . Let's call it popcorn movie . but it's a pity that the legend is like a Mat Kilau made like that"
"For me , right , before you want to see the history of the movie , you have to look at his character . Mat kilau is a warrior + scholar , it must be his context about Islam and the struggle . Let's talk a little about Islam"
Can you imagine that the sacrifice that they do . At the end of the movie you can see most of the villagers come to help Mat Kilau . It does really happen . Guerrilla war as it was called . Please don't mock it if you never appreciate the history . I feel sad
"When I'm a little older , I'm not interested in watching Mat Kilau on Netflix or the cinema . I am not sure to what extent the historical facts in this story are correct . How time has changed . I used to love this kind of"
i actually don't care if this Mat Kilau is good or not all i care is Malaysia is finally making a movie about historical figures fuck off with the choreography or cinematography
"I don't know , I do enjoy Mat Kilau on Netflix , expect a movie from SY , it's a bit like his style , my parents enjoy , I'm enjoying , the fighting so nice , the cine not bad actually , actors n acting"
Good comment . Syamsul has to read the negative comments that build up his movie for his own good . Mat Kilau's success now is due to other factors . The quality of this kind of film does not guarantee the success of his films in the future . He got it
"Sm ppl on TW judge Mat Kilau but for me it such a good movie . Simple but enough with meaning and easy for young gene to understand . Yes maybe the CGI also script and action scene too cringe but come on how can u expect it is same level with hollywood movie , its just from local"
"It may not be suitable for some people's expectations , we watch the movie for various purposes . The first time we saw Mat Kilau , the national hero , while watching the touching story of how our ancestors were killed at will . The 2nd time bring the children to get to know Mat"
"my review on mat kilau movie: can work harder on character development , background sound placement , camerawork , script . feel like everything is rushed son"
"As someone who watched Mat Kilau in cinemas TWICE!!! the dialogue and script really cringe buttttttttt the language and Malay dialect that were used is nicely done actually . It's a movie and it's only based on the true story , why"
"It's true , it really is way behind compared to braveheart or any other historical western movie . But its a step forward from our past . From rempit movies to hantu kak limah etc , now we are making much better quality movies that portray our local figures as"
"hopefully there'd be more proper adaptations of our local heroes , but maybe the next ones will be for other filmmakers to give them justice . sad really , cuz i really love the story of mat kilau as a kid . but then to see him being used as a propa movie this way kinda breaks me"
bcs i feel like the patriotism in me is woken up by watching mat kilau bcs its been years since the last time i watched movies like that
"Mat Kilau cinematography is on a level where it is accepted and I will attack any other movies that leave the movie 'flat' because they are lazy . In their case , the black levels were"
"okay but why's everyone saying watching mat kilau on netflix is . . . yk for me it was the best experience . well maybe because I rarely watch movies . but overall i'm okay with it other people's opinion"" right? shaky camera"" is normal , malay movies"
One more thing about this movie Mat kilau is their script! The script could have sounded more classic . I don't . It's like a member talking to a sitting member
"Movie Mat Kilau , if you have vertigo , don't watch it . Keluaq wayang confirmed that the world is upside down . I can even watch part of the fight scene and feel dizzy"
"I now conclude that some Malaysians don't know how to delve into history and literally make fun of everything , what's so funny about Mat Kilau? It's a good historical movie with tons of heartfelt moments and"
"Thank god I'm not alone , I thought I was the only one who thought Mat Kilau was cringe ah . Actors were great , I just felt the movie was over romanticized with them"
"Mat Kilau is 5 stars in terms of marketing , that's why it costs 100 million . I like Beto's acting in this movie . His eyes are expensive"
"For me , it's the best gilaa movie air force , I feel like your quote should be comparable to Mat Kilau , you know , because it's cheap"
"Tbh , mat kilau was an ok movie . Quite decent but not that impressive . Afterall , we bought the ticket to support local film although I fell asleep at the last 30min of the"
"Mat Kilau is one of the interesting historical movies . Even though the story line has been developed differently from the original story , we have known one of the Malay fighters for a long time"
"I started reading about the history of the Titanic because I just watched the movie Titanic . It's the same after people look at Mat Kilau . At that time , many people were interested in looking back at people to do research on Mat Kilau and read it"
"My 8-year-old stepdaughter has an interest in Mat Kilau . He was really excited when he saw the movie Mat Kilau that day . Until now , he is still crazy about Mat Kilau . From Mat Kilau's story , he found many other histories . I'm tired"
"It's like me in a scene like that Hindustan movie , that is in one of these scenes where Matt puts a dagger on the neck of Captain Syers . . whispers his name and then the music score comes out . "
"A simple review about Mat Kilau film: I just watched it on netflix last night , for the first time , it's a standard local movie , with the most important action sequence style , slow motion must be there , and I have a feeling that this scene looks like a movie scene"
"Yesterday I just saw Mat Kilau . I've been watching people update their ratings . hmmm , personally , there are many shortcomings in this movie , but the story is great for the dialogue part and"
"That's right , after that you can cite Najib for corruption without joining the struggle , why does everything have to be politicized? People just watch the movie , they don't want to watch trashy political stories , they want political talk , wait for the pru , they want to insult the Mat Kilau movie just to insult the political party"
I don't know if I'm not interested in history or if it's the Mat Kilau movie
There is very little history in Mat Kilau . So don't expect too much . There are many facts that are wrong with the movie . I want to watch when I'm bored
People complain about the Mat Kilau camera shaking is suitable for Malays . . . . I mean you guys are right . But the story aduhhh this is my second movie where I ended up standing up swearing in front of the TV after Bukit
"1 . Cringe script 2 . Special Moves mini reunion 3 . Naively narrated 4 . Although the name of the movie is Mat Kilau , from the movie alone , how much did we get to know Mat Kilau? Imo , Beto*s character was more dominant 5 . The sound effect of the fighting scene is extreme , losing the guitar"
"mention this Mat Kilau . . . . he's a great actor I know who's playing but when you watch this movie , from the beginning haha~ line up"
"Hahah , I said this Mat Kilau was inspired by the movie wong feihung because the sound effect is like Chinese martial art"
The raid is an Indonesian film . . the director of captain america only admitted that his fighting scene was inspired by the raid . . even samuel l jackson said that the raid was his all time favorite movie . . this is a Mat Kilau finish you set with the raid
"Special Moves series PASCAL Police Evo Mat Kilau Everyone has their own class Maybe we don't know how many children of Watan whose exposure to police/soldiers/heroes came from this movie For me , this is more important than debating the cinematography issue"
"Can y'all please STFU about reviewing Mat Kilau? If you like it , great . If you don't , it's alright . Everyone has their own taste when watching movies or TV shows . But if y'all make shit up just to fight over a MOVIE , go fuck yourself and touch some grass"
"Actually , I want to rate the Mat Kilau low because I can yawn throughout the story . It rarely happens . But because people buy movie tickets , so I end up rate is high , saying it's good but not the best"
"I hope to be able to see Mat Kilau's character live , what kind of personality he has . his conversational style . what I understand is only philosophy . The script of the movie and the character of Mat Kilau is not"
"When Mat Kilau comes out on neflix , movie critics come out and comment like this , Air Force hasn't yet had a story on neflix , ghisau is turned away by the soldiers who comment later . Guys , to produce a movie requires mental and physical sacrifice from each member"
"That means neutral , you're not Malay , and you don't know Mat Kilau . Character development in the story is very low . There is indeed a messy plot , for example Awang , the motive behind the creation of the role of Awang is not clear . Wanted to turn it into a drama in a movie , but it didn't happen . From the beginning to"
"It's ok , I'll look at this Mat Kilau story . What are you so fussy about? But for me it's not a big impact to have a movie"
"Have you ever seen the IP story? How is he against 10 people? But those who attack him are not all at once . Just like this Mat Kilau story . It's called a story . If you want to be logical , you just read history . No need to look"
"Just looked at the Mat Kilau . It's like watching Isley's Malay speech . The battle scene is dizzying , the camera moves faster than silat . This is the best taste of the movie"
"Mat Kilau is a movie . But netizens who are so sarcastic can't be criticized . There are critics like it should depict 101% of history , which doesn't make sense because the movie is made to appeal to the most segment"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau . It's an enjoyable movie . Despite its flaws , weakness and overuse of fast action shots . "
"Already watched Mat Kilau . How to say? I can only give around 1 out of 5 stars . There are so many weaknesses . If you don't want to get ready to relax , fill in the space or give it to the kids , that's it . But not recommended at all for action movies/dramas & history lovers . I like action genre and history"
"Malay klu in the chat section condemned person no . 1 . Hg tgk movie not documentary . He has already made a disclaimer . He has a movie he likes . It's not based on the true story of the last two blackhawkdowns , the west didn't win apo . Suh barat has a hero to make a new Mat Kilau comparable to your taste"
"what you should be angry about is how shitty the movie was made based on the legendary mat kilau . flawed dialogue , cinematography kl"
not surprised to see mat kilau getting low ratings from people . i've said it before that the pacing was so off and the dialogue sounds pretentious in every way . you can make a patriotic/historical movie without it being as messy as it is
"I always tell people who haven't seen Mat Kilau , if you want to see the film version of Perhimpunan Agong UMNO . . . Watch the film . It's a bad movie . The positive from the movie , Beto"
"true! many discussions in terms of expanding knowledge in history this what historical movies should be , endless discussion . Independence does not happen without discussions . mat kilau is more like promoting culture w history but history is more"
"Since yesterday Mat Kilau started showing on Netflix , it seems that there are more and more negative reviews lol . yes that movie is such a meh . People were not exaggerating tho about the shaky camera . Character development almost none , and the story ends with the climax , no"
"Those who don't like watching Mat Kilau movies are welcome . . It's up to each other . . . But I'm ready to stamp people who like to watch that story as ""low IQ"" that's more than enough . . . . . Lek2 dahlew…"
Is the Mat Kilau movie good? It's a movie . Has a specific appeal . Triggers some specific feelings . Doesn't really leave a lasting impression . Not the actors nor crew's fault . The producer and director just have a specific mission . Was never meant to be
"I admit that mat kilau only has 6-7 over 10 storylines . But the acting and effort to produce such a movie is a power , it can cover up the weaknesses of this story . A lot of people just watch it on netflix for"
"Personally , I really don't like the movie directed by Yusoff's son because I've seen it once on TV , Munafik . Hahahaha so when this Mat Kilau comes out , I'm skeptical when people say it's crazy . The timeline is full of words , it's not the best when it's on Netflix . Fortunately , I didn't run out of money"
"Don't compare it with foreign movies , local movies too , sergeant hassan , even paskal . There is the same element of patriotic spirit without the cringe dialogue & messy plot . But Mat Kilau is still crazy , just because it's Malaysian . Try to turn off the hype & watch it with a neutral feeling . Still"
Who is the famous movie critic in Malaysia who dares to promote that Mat Kilau? Now I really doubt his credibility . What the hell do you think this is a crazy solid story? You have no taste
I just feel like watching a movie
Also why do I think Fattah Amin's acting in Mat Kilau is better than everyone else especially Mat Kilau himself . One expression is the whole
"I don't like people on Twitter who ""after 10 minutes open the Mat Kilau near netflix , it closes immediately"" I don't know what is your intention to say that . Then add on , ""it's suitable for Malays"" Haah , you're really distracted watching all the movies . The story is old , people are hyped"
"People say that Mat Kilau stories are adaptations , if you want facts , you should read history books . but now his issue is not just historical fact , but plot , character development , cinematography . one more thing , not because there is high expectation , but this movie is just like this"
"Finally got to watch Mat Kilau via netflix . Well , I must say good movie for a Malay historical genre n of coz the star studded cast . Didn't know tis Mat Kilau is"
"After watching the scene against Mat Kilau , I conclude that only deep people can accept the story from this alarming POV . I just want to relax and watch more movies"
Up back Mat Kilau's tweet since Netflix came out . You can enter the history of this movie . The success
What's the point of arguing about Mat Kilau for months without end . You're not the one who turned into a stunt instead of fattah amin fighting in that movie
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film . From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot . What do you get? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive , I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing . That's why he brought in the premiere"
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film . From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot . What do you get? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive , I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing . That's why during the premiere he was transported into the movie"
"Just need to add on how it is . The note that was given to the villagers for taxation , ends with ""God save the queen"" . During 1892 ""mat kilau movie setting"" the ruler of England was King George V . Small details Mat Kilaur's"
"This mat kilau story focuses on the character development of the mat kilau friends the camera does not shake , who said shake , is a liar , the camera has a lot of close ups to martial arts techniques , and the action is fast but can still be captured and understood no problem with audio"
"Mat Kilau cinematography and its continuity could be a lot , A LOT better . The script and wording doesn't really scream quality movie . Limited character development . I mean . . I enjoyed Ejen Ali the Movie much more than"
"Had to watch Air Force the movie and the visuals were so bad! Still dizzy . . the story for me is best based on Malaysia has a film industry , the same goes to Mat Kilau . . well no Mat Kilaur what we can't compare our local films with films from other countries . Malaysia is fine"
"Can withstand the bad review of Mat Kilau . I didn't see it . Shuk saw yesterday . But I came out of the room and asked him what movie he was watching because I heard howling screams and felt nervous . I was like ""What movie is that? It sounds like chaos . I have to scream even if I want to talk"
"From the beginning when I watched Mat Kilau , I said that the story was not the best . There are so many over scenes that it becomes clingy . The best Malay movie is Knife"
"The queen died between Aug . 31 and Sept . 16 , two very important dates for Malaysian nationalism , in a country still debating its independence narrative and colonial history . Just recently , an anti-British colonial era movie 'Mat Kilau' made over 100m ringgit in the"
"It's okay , I looked at the Mat Kilau , the empty one turned away from history . . the movie critics turned away , what's the Mat Kilaur . Just enjoy it . Woke indeterminate"
"Citer Mat Kilau is really bad . Script , plot , acting , all levels of the theater club at uni . I don't immediately feel sad or angry when I see a scene . Even the martial arts fight scene looks like Wing Chun . Anyone who thinks this movie is the best should not give an opinion about any movie"
Mat Kilau has many shortcomings in his storyline . His dialogue and acting are also amazing . But right timing when many are thirsty for this kind of movie - the strongest impact is on the kids - to inculcate the feeling of
"They are using Mat Kilau's name for the movie , he's the main character , so I think the least they could do is add in a little bit of history to show that he's ""Mat Kilau"" . I'm not talking about 100% history , but at least I think there should be a distinctive scene based on"
"Mat Kilau said the sound of poetry Disney stories sing and sing To me , the movie is ordinary , more like propaganda . But mat saleh's story is also a lot of propaganda . So that's normal . What's not normal is that the camera works like a fly , flying"
"Movie Mat Mat Kilau is easy to understand and digest . Direct to the point . . I think the presentation is important . . if you want to understand this history you have to be relaxed . if you are serious , people will run away and not want to see"
"Syamsul Yusof doesn't even want to make a good movie . But he wants to make a movie that exploits this theme . Gangsterism (KL Gangster) , Witchcraft & Dark Arts (Hypocrisy) , Malay history (Mat"
"Done watching mat glitter on netflix . Why netflix because there is a small child , it is not suitable to take to the cinema . Mat Kilau review: Everything is ok , the story line (must be based on a true story right) , the color of the movie is ok . But , there are some"
"What people (initially) think are the reasons Mat Kilau is no 1: awesome cinematography , soundtrack , great cgi and fight choreography . Why its really no 1 in Malaysia: Malaysians crave movies depicting local figures as inspiring"
"Honestly , I enjoyed watching Mat Kilau in theater with my family . But . . . yes , the sound , camera and script thing mmng . His sound effect is so loud and over the top that even my 3-year-old nephew doesn't even notice . He was angry until the movie was over , he didn't bother people"
"I don't even think I want to look at it . I know enough about his history , even in that movie he worked out a little bit to become that tall . Do you want to be distracted by the movie , the critic can't be criticized , it's you who are distracted , that syamsul is eating a delicious steak"
"yes , I know that some will be like 'mat kilau , okay what , at least it's different from other movies , which are fun stories about love or gangsters etc' yes , that is undeniable but all this critic & review means that there is more room for films Malaysia to"
"what's the problem with this Mat Kilau story? Malaysians are condemned to work . You also condemn the air force story . you just make the movie . I don't like it , it's okay , I don't care . sit still"
"; There are so many people condemning the Mat Kilau movie that they just watched on Netflix that they feel like they have a low IQ level . Lol , you're confused , you have a high iq , you can go on the road with your opinion . Aachah2 turned away"
"Tgk Mat Kilau reminds me of RRR . . . the format is the same . . . intensity , background music , action are all the best , only the shaking camera part is a bit lacking . . . But still a"
"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . A very decent movie I must say . 3 . 5/5 His martial arts part is the best!!! The dialogue is solid , piercing the heart!!! Cinematography could do better"
I'll look at that Mat Kilau later . I feel like I want to watch an English movie but I don't know how
Now why do you have to rely on Zhaf to have a movie comment eh? I don't know when he trashed all the movies on your thumbnail for clickbait . Not creative . And Mat Kilau is directed by Syamsul Yusuf . It can be said that this story is just a popcorn movie . Not a top-tier kinda
"Not a fan of Mat Kilau but at least I have something to watch on netflix with my parents . Instead of English movie with 'awkward scene' or never ending Malay ghost story , rempit movie , "
Am i the only one who wasn't really impressed with
"But sis , that's the struggle of our fighters from the age of luck until the end . Their main struggle is to fight for the dignity of religion , nation and homeland . For me the script was realistic , maybe it could be completely interesting with the movie editing technique"
"After watching the Mat Kilau movie . The camera is not relaxing . Left right front back . Part opponent to jetty to tgh bersilat to . X relax eh . Time to chat with a lot of people , change the shot every 2 seconds . Eye pain , loss of focus . Suddenly the drone shot , went back in for a close shot"
"instead of watching Mat Kilau , you should watch Paloh , a good pseudo historical movie by adman salleh . although the editing was quite poor I don't mind as long as the actors were paid well"
"Ni citer Mat Kilau or the documentary History of the school syllabus , "
"Same concept as Marvel . Does the physics theory in Marvel make everyone 100% explore physics? But people talk about it . Same as this I never saw people discussing about mat kilau on social media beside textbook history . After this movie , people talk about Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau"
"Sis kept looking at twitter , searching about Mat Kilau after watching not even half of the movie . It's just a minimum bear , it's just that Malaysia hasn't come out with a concept story like this for a long time , hence , people are a bit overhyped (a lot actually) . Ok that's the end of the story sis comment back even nobody"
"It's ok , the Mat Kilau story , I don't want it to be so bad , I'm ready to make a thread like this . Malay people really like to put down Malay people , there are many Korean stories that are overhyped and there is no plaque that the Malays want to comment until they make a thread . Lol I'm the best at watching movies"
Fil has been feeling a bit under a weather today and asked me to record mat kilau on netflix he didnt want to miss our movie nite ok postpone
"Too many critics on Mat Kilau But honestly , I don't think it's a very bad movie , it can be a bonus to feel proud with enthusiasm . But air force srsly his vibes are different . 2 times aq usha and both aq nangeh . I've tried it many times but I still can't feel it"
"Precisely . . The shaking camerawork is actually to make the audience feel the situation in the movie . . And I really don't have any problem with the camerawork either in Mat Kilau and air force the movie , but still . . I understand , they need to improve of those tiny errors in their"
Watching Mat Kilau is like watching a Tamil movie . martial arts fighting is normal but he has a sound over
"When talking about Mat Kilau , people must want to know for example: -Who is the Mat Kilau? -How is his life? -Who is his teacher? The best example of Merong Mahawangsa movie . Character building is solid . Just technology , budget , not suitable & Merong's history is much more"
"I stand by my decision . . . Mat Kilau is a good story , I rate it high but it doesn't make it into the all time fav movie"
"i will say it here bcos my friend loves it . but Mat Kilau is a horrible movie in terms of the writing , directing & camerawork . But the casts are amazing with so little things they can work with"
"Haha , after it came out on netflix , people just realized that it was overhyped . Maybe it's because the reviewers all give high ratings that it's overhyped . It's not that I don't want to support Malay movies , but in terms of the plot , the movie is normal . For me air force again"
I saw mat kilau on netflix with the same reaction in the movie that I watched about 5 times . . hahaha I don't understand the people who make the movie tell me about the story of mat kilau . . hahaha sian eh
"I rarely review a film on social media but here goes Mat Kilau is 0 . 2/10 . I had nothing against our forefathers sacrifice . But it was an overhype movie , the dialog/narrative was poor and there were no Pahang people"
"if you want to watch Malay movies related to history , watch puteri gunung ledang , 29 februari and lieutenant adnan . please don't waste your time on mat kilau . "
There are many dialogues that are quite piercing in Mat Kilau's story . A very good
"I'm not that well-versed in story telling but it's not wrong to be critical because I love this kind of movies being made more into our art industry , it's more about giving a good message , like citing mat kilau of course at least The plotline isn't too much"
"Movie Mat Kilau is okay , good try . Its a soap opera about Malay warriors . I want to make it like Ip Man but the cinematography fighting scene is like hauk . Watch the movie"
but if anyone wants to make a badang story please cast fattah amin his action scene in mat kilau movie is
"mat kilau is not as good as yall said it was , i mean the dialogue is disappointing as i expected classic language e . g . pramlee's movie , the color grading does not fit the setting of the film , fighting choreography is okay cun but the camera is not"
"What a rubbish production of this Mat Kilau movie . The cinematography is over the top , the fight sequence is clumsy , the plot of the movie is like spongebob . Lang Buana is the best"
Just finished watching Mat Kilau on Netflix . If there is no Beto Pishang baby . Charisma A++ . Special mention goes to Fattah . Best performance yet . Don't ask me what I think about the movie . I want to make something worth 100 million
"None of Mat Kilau's history is available . Mat kilau is a catfish for tgk people . Its more of a movie to make Malays realize 'this is ur land , dont chicken out and defend it like what our forefathers did for"
"""it's not the best to quote this , it sounds like he's over"" my bro to mat kilau"
"""it's not the best to quote this , it sounds like he's over"" my bro to mat kilau"
"I love history . I love movies . But sorry to say , Mat Kilau is meh . I have written some things that are not logical , but I don't want to share them all on twitter , there are too many . Malaysian directors and team need to watch more international movies to learn"
"Today the movie Mat Kilau is out on Netflix . I'm sorry , am I the only one who thinks this story is overrated? I like Puteri Gunung Ledang again . At the beginning of the Mat Kilau movies , I started asking , was there an inner hood in the old days?"
mama as a history teacher said something wrong w mat kilau the
"the biggest mistake coming from the most visible film was the fact that NO ONE used the Pahang accent throughout the whole movie , especially when it was set at Jerantut like come on"
I hope you don't lose the luster like you do in brsilat . But watching air force the movie feels the sacrifice of our army for the sake of the country . The sense of sacrifice that we hope is our own is not always possible . . . Cita is a lot of dead characters
"Air Force , the movie is really hyped , it's like a Mat Kilau finish . Jlan Cita is the best . X cliché , fighting hard . . fighting hard . The path of ambition is crazy . It feels like the sacrifice of a military hero . . There are only one or two characters that stand out . Wlupn core cita psai Rock ngn"
"I want to ask a little , the one who is interested in the Mat Kilau movie reference , don't you study History at school? After watching the movie , will you know about Mat Kilau and the battle against oppressors? If this is the case , just abolish the History subject and replace it with a subject"
"Lps mat kilau , many people spread hate towards british for colonizing malaysia and scooping up all the earth's produce . But . . How bou japan? Is it because the movie ""embun"" doesn't top like a Mat Kilau? In conclusion we can't erase history but why bother until you want to play racist"
"The one who said that is gobloq . Ignore it . A lot of people watch Mat Kilau because this is one of the film makers' efforts to build a movie about history after a long time . The effort is pretty good . We also study hero Mat Kilau in school . Therefore , many dtg"
"I'm not interested in the Mat Kilau movie , but imagine how he felt when he saw the government of the state pouring its own land in the direction of flying the flag at half-mast for three days . "
3 . Mat Kilau I feel sleepy watching this movie but this movie is worth it
Watched Air Force The Movie: Selagi Bernyawa yesterday with my family . It's AWESOME! My unpopular opinion: still the best from Mat Kilau and Paskal . I like the story line and how suspenseful a war situation can be . I brought me in the situation like I was actually in the
"why is the speaker sound at GSC Kluang so bad , especially at hall 1 when I see the lack of luster then airforce the movie at hall 3 . It's a serious spoiler"
