"Invite the people to boycott the upcoming box office movies that will be released soon . Don't forget that the movie industry is also their biggest contributor , what's more , the movie Wonder Woman clearly shows the perpetrators of the Jewish race . Try to see the movie in the Mat Kilau country box office in our country alone , how much has it collected . "
"JUST LAST YEAR THE MOVIE MAT KILAU OI CAME OUT! LIKE OR HATE THAT MOVIE IT'S A MOVIE LITERALLY ABOUT OUR ANCESTORS FIGHTING BRITISH COLONIZERS , APA BEBAL NAK NEUTRAL2 WHEN A LITERAL GENOCIDE IS HAPPENING! THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE COLONIST AGAIN CAN REMOVE IT! PTUI!"

"It's true that Mat Kilau is a fighter . He fought against the oppression of his era . He's not a gangster who collects taxes . Gangsters who number 1 run away from war . lg 1 , fuck movie mat"
"When I knew my son was a boy , I got so inspired by your bravery . That time is already peak with Mat Kilau movie . Like I really wanted and I prayed my son to have this kind of bravery and his adherence to Islam is strong in his veins . Hence his name now"
He remembers him like Mat Kilau the movie who hates English
"I remember the time of the phenomenon of the movie Mat Kilau , when more and more people were proud to be Malay , wearing traditional clothes , at that time there were many crazy people who didn't like it , understand where it came from . These things will make Malay extremists like the Taliban . It is not impossible that the Malays themselves will come to stamp"
Indian Mat Kilau
sorry I never watched the movie until the end . He said
"eh , I don't misunderstand , I don't know that sentence because I've never seen the movie mat kilau"
"Because 4 of them , Israel will kill people slowly because they want to do ethnic cleansing . Fight instead of waiting to die . Nk tgu level army sma mmg xnknla . . we watch 'mat kilau' the movie and yet we still question ppl who fought against"
"Finally watched Mat Kilau yesterday No other Malaysian movie could match its theatrical , comedic and historical-inaccuracy value . . . Best line: ""Dazzling dagger , my name is Mat"
"That's why in the movie mat kilau , the British captain once said , we are a weak nation , a divided nation , we are never United . That's why you are weak . What he said is true , I agree , if we all unite , our nation will be strong . Sad that our nation is broken"
"always proud of what our nation can achieve . I support local films . To do better we need to compete productively . In this era , the source of movies is limitless . Ola Bola , Mat Kilau to name a few are all local blockbusters . Give it sometimes for local films to grow . "
"Hamas is a Hero for Palestinians , see the movie ""Mat Kilau"" , how he defends Malay land from British colonialism . Did he a"
"about reading a book to know this history , I once talked to someone who saw the movie Mat Kilau and completely believed what he showed . when I told him to read a book , he said I don't know Malay . I'm too lazy to debate with people who want to go to the toilet"
The same person blames the Malays for the controversy movie Mat Kilau Tu
"I also remember the film that was not the best , it was dark and full of stress"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau . Although the situation our predecessors in Malay Archipelago had passed through were much more difficult , movies like this need to be massively produced to make us always remember that kafir and Kuffar nations will always be our enemy then and now . "
MALAYSIANS remember when we were all obsessed over Mat Kilau (the movie)? especially the girls when we thought some of the 6 casts were
"I don't even quote Mat Kilau because I know his history is not the same as what I read in the book , so people use the movie as an ideology . Sometimes I ask the gangs who watch this movie if there are certain scenes that don't follow history"
Annoying Voice of Hun Haqiem = Movie Mat
"Really though . Mat Kilau is a far better movie than this , and Mat Kilau was ahistorical ethnonationalist diarrhea . Hot take time! My bet for best Malaysian movie of the last few years is , and don't kill me for this: PASKAL . That was a fucking kinetic"
Mende babi look at Mat Kilau cry good watch upin ipin the movie
"Yes , I opened the movie because I wanted to cry , I was already looking for the sad part . But look at the Mat Kilau and cry hahaha"
remind me there is a parade from the cast of the movie eramalat cuz last year there was a mat
"Wow , have you seen it? Go fast sister! Nooo Mat Kilau was the worst Malay movie ever! Until now , the trauma of going to see that movie is a waste of 20+ sisters . 6 . 5 is okay then 5 . There are so many people with level 2"
Mat Kilau/Polis Evo 3/Paskal (All Are Malaysian Movies But OMG The Best
"But honestly , Mat Kilau is not very strong plot-wise . The movie has strong support because it has a political element"
"There is a Kanang Anak Kankau movie . Even made earlier than Mat Kilau . The Borneo women just make it worse , they say we are racist to them . Very influenced to be like a black American"
"There is a Kanang Anak Kankau movie . Even made earlier than Mat Kilau . The women just make it worse , they say we are racist towards them . Very influenced by the black narrative"
Mat kilau movie singlehandedly helps PN win the PRN . Ytjt Mat Kilau
"If the movie follows the historical facts about Mat Kilau , it will look 10 times more supremacy because he really fought all the way . His life story is sad . He was under-appreciated"
The Mat Kilau is fine . There are many other movies available . He can be blamed for the Mat Kilau of a movie . What is the fate of the people of Malaysia?
Just watched Sultan Agung on Netflix . I must say every single thing in this movie is far beyond better than Mat Kilau . Story telling: 10 Plot: 10 Script: 10 Cinematography: 9 Acting:
"Movie Mat Kilau is also sold , you want to expect"
Where is the enthusiasm to watch the Mat Kilau movie?
I don't think that's the reason . The people are now ready to vote . . nonsensical stories have no essence . What do you want to support? Example of movie mat
"I thought I would never be able to find an even worse film than Mat Kilau: I was wrong . Iceman : The Time Traveler was a total mess and cringefest . How the fuck dud that movie even got released , "
"fak you men mat kilau haters , mat kilau shat on these movies"
"Tbh right now , you gimme one podium and i read out what i have , i sound like im in the mat kilau movie"
Greta Gerwig's movies are deffo not to the taste of Malays in Malaysia . I guess they'd rather stick to their Mat Kilau
Mat Kilau movies like that are also high-grossing . Good quality Evo police can't even get the collection they deserve . 
"If you want to fight the action-packed Mat Kilau , Christopher Nolan will lose . p/s : Mat Kilau (the film) is not a movie , it's a piece of"
Look at the acceptance of our people . Just look at what happened at mat kilau movies

"Ever since I watched the movie mat kilau , I have learned a lot of language"
"Where? We were in MMU Theater competitions together . Perempuan Itu (long time no TV especially Malay drama) is it Isma's? For years I never followed , last Malay stories I watched was Mat Kilau & the aviation movie"
"Become a song composer and film producer . What songs/movies are hits now , I told myself 10 years ago Examples of the movie Mat Kilau and the song go live for kat aina"
My cousins are watching Mat Kilau so I watched it too What is this movie
Indonesia can produce movies like Big 4 and Hitmen but we are still stuck with Polis Evo and Mat Kilau . Indonesia can produce movies like Qodrat but Malaysia is still stuck with Munafik . 
Uncle . I just finished watching Extraction 2 . Sol Mat Kilau shot the movie
I haven't watched a movie in a long time
Hahaha I can't even see it . Not to mention the movie movie will
"His camera work is not like the style I did in the Mat Kilau film , and it is not like the Kingsman style of camera work . I don't remember what movie , but it's not like a typical mission impossible movie or a common action movie camera work , it's"
Short snippets of Mat Kilau movie will now be used to advance identity politics of race and religion as many have started emerging on social media! Using the snippets out of context can and may inflame people! 6 state elections are coming! Contest based on ideas /

Puteri gunung ledang movie is so nice . It is beautifully written and it is exactly what mat kilau's writer had ever dreamed of but could never come close to
"You have to make a quality movie to lift your spirits History - ""Mat Kilau"" BM - BI - Math - Science"
"hahaha . . . Mat Kilau movie , of all"
and thought it is so hilarious he chose to make reference from a dialogue in the movie Mat Kilau to support his view???
"Just look at the Mat Kilau of the movie , how do you know how to use history as you see fit . Don't look at it comprehensively . The one who makes the movie and the one who watches the movie . The mentality is the same"
"Polis evo 3 is good . It's not powerful , but it's delicious . I don't think it's a waste to watch a local movie like this near the cinema . Light plot . Action sequence is nice , even better than Mat Kilau in terms of sound and camera angle . The armor plot is thick , but if you look at one piece , you don't even complain . "
"have to make sure that the movie that is made is the best , crazy , then hype , then the quotes beat the Mat Kilau , then people can buy things"
"What to do , with the recent voting trends by the first time voters , influences by dumb tiktok videos , not capable of thinking , movies like mat Kilau which portrays non as enemy . . . . This route is taken to get"
Just watched polis evo 3 . Was an okay movie . Predictable plot . 6/10 for me . BOOT!! Everyone else laughed and enjoyed the movie so much . Ready to get applause from people in the movie hall . But this one can get applause better than the Mat Kilau movie
"Mat Kilau is historical , not a stupid political quote . If you want to make a movie to promote yourself , you can't afford it"
"Movie Mat Kilau best . All of us are excited about the anti-colonial side . Ready to fall in love with martial arts . Anwar's movie , no appeal . I'm asking the boys now , did the movie go viral?"
"It's no problem . . you can do it . . you don't want it . . it's not weird for promotion . . as an example , there are also films like this . . if you want to make a movie about Pas characters . . don't bother . . already confirm 1 . 8 billion worldwide views . . "
I compared it with Mat Kilau for no apparent reasons . Just being bitter because the movie sucks
"But even if I have to , this movie needs to exist (just like Mat Kilau) , to make way for better biopics in the future . Or how not"
"Ermm . . it feels like there are many free tickets at mat kilau . . I got free tickets at mat kilau 4 times . . police evo 3 twice . . I haven't been able to get this anwar untold story because it's fun to run out of free ones . . just like any free movie I've ever had I don't know hahahah . . if it's possible , I'll do it like this for another movie"
"I just finished watching it . Aq perati One2 seats that show full on the website n All are full . Also , other people come . Yes , there are free tickets . But there are other movies too (tanda putera , Mat Kilau) . Why are you fussing?"
"So movie bangnon with Mat Kilau , where else? Dialogue , story line , "
"Mat Kilau . The advertisement is too much . I was also affected . When I saw it , I stopped . 1 old plot . Cinema even gives full slots/day instead of 4 slots/day per cinema movie"
"right? The other day , it was said that it can be used against sale Mat Kilau . to make a movie that doesn't use this hill can only be a dream . "
"Make fun of him because he doesn't focus on the story line and then tears up . . The message of the movie is good and important , there is no touch plate . You're just dizzy"
Mat Kilau > Anwar *In terms of the movie
"Anwar & Mat Kilau movie . I've noticed that Malaysians are too much against/glorifying the fact that films like fact/documentaries . Of course there are inaccuracies/fallacies . Do you really believe that Leonardo Dicaprio died on the Titanic?? It's just a movie , bro . Just enjoy it as it is"
"do movie on Mahathir instead , first day can collect 10 million ringgit and consistently getting 5 - 10 million ringgit for 30 weeks . bok can beat Mat"
"Both are not the best . Objectively speaking , this movie opened strong then withered as an unnecessary PSA that made the ending feel abrupt . Mat Kilau was horrifying in terms of blatant propaganda packaged as a warrior"
"Farid Kamil should have called that chubby first before letting him watch the movie , only to get a high rating like Mat"
We need to make more movies like Mat Kilau than movies that involve stupid
"Yeahh in a Malaysian movie ""Mat Kilau"" he was a good one"
I watched a Mat Kilau movie . He was right . Malay is as noble as creed as religion
"Memali The Movie if you style opponents like Mat Kilau , it's best . Who is suitable to hold the character of ayoh chik? Hasnul like in Polis Evo 2 is also ok"
" . . . I X criticize the movie people say 10/10 , he dogged other people . Even though the review itself is 5/5 Mat Kilau . Stupid"
"Example for me , I strongly disagree with reviewers who say Mat Kilau is the best . I don't like the other movies he recommended . So I ignore him . Chris Stuckkman(?) recommends a lot of stories that I like . There are a few that don't match but so far I'm satisfied"
I watched the last movie review
"I don't know , I didn't even look at it again but . . . Mat Kilau gave him 5/5? Wtf If you want to make a historical film , make it like Lieutenant Adnan , Bukit Kepong , Bang Rajan . It's just real , this is a market in a Mat Kilau movie like a village nasi lemak stall"
Mat Kilau the movie sgt
"shut up , you're busy . back up people who are 5/5 Mat Kilau xde taste movie . BOO"
Is there anyone else who reviews this movie? he turned away
"When I first wanted to watch this PMX movie , I remembered Mat Kilau , but then it didn't happen . Hrmm , don't be afraid of wasting money &"
"I didn't see it until the end of his review . He praises has a basis , he criticizes curses has a basis . You are exaggerating . Why only mention Mat Kilau? He praises animated movies . He licks too"
"Even Mat Kilau can get 5/10 . In 4/10 only . Watch twice , fall asleep twice . Never fell asleep watching a movie at the cinema , but Mat Kilau"
Why do you want to compare Mat Kilau with Movie Bang Non? Movie Bang Non There are opponents fighting each other
"Aah , it's the same . We'll see that it's okay , that Mat Kilau . I don't even think about the movie . Look for fun . If it's fun , it's fun . But it's true , after he made sarah cem , it became a waste on the sole"
"Apart from the overrated movie mat kilau , haters even overrated hate the movie"
"To this day , I'm strange , how did Mamat turn the movie review for a high rating on that Mat Kilau . When he reviews , he always emphasizes the aspect of cinematography , but in Mat Kilau , it is badly destroyed . The cackling camera is too bad . Campelaq . That's the one"
I suspect the Mat Kilau movie will have to be quoted again if there is a review
That's the quantity . Great a movie based on quality not quantity . That's the level of taste Malaysians want to make . Do many Malaysians watch the highest rated movie worldwide? That's why it flopped when it entered the Indonesian market . The quality of Indonesian movies is much better
The highest-lowest grossing thread of 47 films in 2022: Mat Kilau - RM 89 . 42 million Mechamato Movie - 35 . 88 million Air Force The Movie - 29 . 38 million Abang Long Fadil 3 - 24 . 27 million Talbis Iblis - 4 . 12 million The Assistant - 2 . 44 million Nasi Lemak 1 . 0 - 2 . 10 million Remp-It 2 - 1 . 90
"Why did I think of Bell? Hahahaha eheh Beto in Mat Kilau . After the movie , he eclipsed everyone1 I think . This Raya , his face is everywhere! + The star moon & the sweet fat song are over"
Just watched Mat Kilau Why did they treat Mat Kilau's fight scenes as the characters were superheroes . . . The movie itself was OKAY but the glaring issues came from the fight scenes and Captain Syers (his writing was honestly pretty comical it was
Better than all malaysian movies better than Mat Kilau camera Mat Kilau
What record is this uki? This movie looks like dark web
"After the Mat Kilau movie , everybody is a"
"first of all , i never agree with people who condescend the legend Mat Kilau himself , ofc he is one of our national heroes . however , it is never a reason for people to justify shamsul bcs the movie just was terrible and deceptive for so many"
"Yeah because whenever I found a guy idolising mat kilau , he's referring to syamsul yusof's"
"Mat Kilau , the first movie in my life . Soo next we wait , Malbat Mission Bakara | Black Hawk Down . If history he follows what America and the West write . Auto"
Shamsul Yusof . want to make a 2-use Mat Kilau film
"because I don't know you very well , not because of race . If Chin View is making a movie with Mat Kilau and Yusof Haslam's son or the devil boy actor , what's the point? lol . like the case of shooting a pregnant wife , because the perpetrators are not female so there is no hype . That's because of him"
"Those who deny that the British committed murder , destroyed houses , killed villagers in Pahang just like in the movie Mat Kilau . . you should see the episode of the Messenger's Footsteps today . . there is an academic here . "

"That's right , during the Mat Kilau movie , they kind of dropped that movie , he said he was racist"
what if Malaysia were to make a film on Mahsuri history? would it have a great feedback and engagements such as Mat Kilau and other historic
There are many black raya themes this year . Then the pot bay . The influence of the customer's Mat Kilaute film
"Many movies I've seen in the cinema , but the movies are the most wasteful . It's more hype than the story , it's biased , it's more of a war scene"
Wow . Movie Mat Kilau 2 is
Can the camera man register as a camera man for the next movie mat
Imagine the camera work in this movie is better than Mat Kilau tah maybe choreography is also
This is not from a Mat Kilau movie
i saw munafik and mat kilau movies and i feel like they are made are made for boring people it is so . . . local omggg . usually love the direction and theme of these but the execution and script are rubbish
last got a movie leak story mat kilau full movie looks like it looks like
"We have never been interested in his movie genres since the beginning , except for the latest one , it's a bit dull . I was never interested in his previous movie"
People say that Mat Kilau movie is bad because of bad script . But I didn't expect it was actually REALLY BAD The characters don't have realistic conversations . They just throw 'big quotes' on every chance they get . Like a coffee chat to fight who can say the 'wokest'
Time to stop watching syamsul's movie . Even Mat Kilau is like garbage
His movies are rubbish . You idiots are quickly impressed with Mat
"Fortunately , I have never seen that Mat Kilau movie . Will not support people's business"
My colleague got it finally Tht Mat kilau is too heavy for kids . . now playing suitable for kids and let them know our local animation movies r on par with
"Boycott the movie samsol tok . Even though I'm happy with my luck , I don't go to the movies . Sis"
"If there is a time machine , I want to take Mat Kilau to watch the movie Mat Kilau , let him fight in the theater to see how cringe the movie is . "
"Your movie is trash , many netizens admit that , until Roman Akhramovic lost its luster , why did it enter the Indo market , low rating , praised by its own country . whereas Indonesian movies entering Malaysia get high ratings and are well received"
"In terms of history and heritage , there seems to be no promotion while Pahang could have ride on the Mat Kilau movie and sell Kg Pulau Tawar as a tourism object . Sell Ulu Cheka via Pawang Noh a lesser known legend . There is a Pawang Noh Gallery in Ulu Cheka that is not on the tourism"
"There is a truth , there is a mistake in this statement . Personal is personal . But there are issues like beating people who don't want to stay in support . Let's see if his movie sells or not . Even though the drama penyondol has started and the movie isn't the best , the Mat Kilau is also sold"
"Favorite Movies: Turning Red , Mat Kilau , Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2022 , A Werewolf Boy , All Avatar Movies , Kung Fu Hustle , Secret Zoo , Tokyo Revengers Live Action & Lagenda Budak"
Owh you felt agitated when it came to anything about 'sensitivities'? I wonder where are you when non-Muslims felt 'sensitive' about 'Mat Kilau' movie Every race & religion have their unique sensitivities . Even those feminist movements have
"Some kuning likes to make plots , Raja Abdullah for example . The regiment may be a plot just like how Javanese joined Heiho during Jp occupation there , then used the combat skills to fight against imperialists . But watching Mat Kilau movie followed by Lt . Adnan movie is just"
"I looked at tiktok and suddenly came out after the syamsul/aaron mess . Haha , having watched syamsul's movies , I think he's suitable for gangsters . I was madly disappointed that day . His narration is beautiful . But oh God , his cinematography is ruined . I want to see"
Maybe Mat Sakau the movie will win Oscar since Mat Kilau
"And I think this movie is more successful for the atmosphere of the Malay people than the Mat Kilau movie . Historically fact , I don't know if it is correct or not . It's just that his old Malay vibe is still alive"
"I don't think Mat Kilau , another scenario and the movie scenario make me less masculine . Or maybe its just your netflix secretly spreading the degenerate ideologies like lgbtq"
"I doubt she would be as successful as she is now even if she got full support . Malaysia's market power is too low compared to Hong Kong and Hollywood . Just look Mat Kilau , highest grossing but only 97 mil ringgit far cry from the most mediocre direct to cd Disney movies"
"Malaysians don't deserve TSMY , just go and celebrate mat kilau"
"I think EEAAO is also a story that if a fan of the Mat Kilau movie sees , he will not understand and will not"
"please differentiate between soap operas and movies , and what is the difference between malay moves better? the fact is that msians movies are still far below the level of indo , mat kilaua which was boasted in the past is even equivalent to the quality of indo years"
Imaginur is a movie about Alzheimer's . Nothing much . Overhyped same as Matt
Imaginary . One of the movies I couldn't sleep this year . Solid like the second Malay story I didn't sleep after the luster . Maybe Beto Kusyairi's and Diana Danielle's acting will be right . I can't sleep because everything is a problem and unpredictable . 
"Random thought . As much as I don't like Mat Kilau , they kinda dropped the ball by not releasing any OST . People are streaming Hasrat after watching Imaginur and the movie has only 3 million collections . Granted it is a good song and its my new sendu song . I just think its a missed"
hahaha I'm not sure if Malay movies are hard to watch in cinemas . You can count with your fingers haha . . I always wait for Astro to come out . I can't see it on netflix . 
Yes . . . . I think so too he is protecting his money and other assets . . . . his Mat Kilau movie which he directed made RM 100 million in the box office
"It's nice to know that the movie is the best and is there any content? After leaving the movie , you feel like watching it again . make me feel like that . Mat Kilau makes me want to refund my money & time . "
"Movies like this are what we should praise , not like death"
Mat Kilau is one of the most regrettable movies I've ever seen
"Congratulations , you discovered how the movie business works? Do you want a PhD? How do you think Mat Kilau did so well at the box office?"
A movie should be a movie . It's not like a school Independence Day time video play . Talking about Mat Kilau and all the movies that are similar
"The film industry here wants to win an Oscar at the Academy Awards so bad but when you send a mediocre (personally IMO , really badly made) movie like Mat Kilau as a contender , I feel like there is no"
Compare imaginur with Mat Kilau like comparing movie avengers with beautiful
"For every 'Mat Kilau' movie , there is a 'Flying Butter' . . . I say , why"
Mat Kilau . There is no historical story . Letop2 can box office . It seems that Malaysians like this type of movie
People want to compare with Habibie & Ainun but they forgot that he was already retired by the time those movies were out . And Indonesians are mostly more big-hearted when it comes to films . Malaysians are conflicted about Mat
"Some people say that Anwar's untold story is not to be believed because there may be additions to make the story more beautiful . that's the end of the Mat Kilau story , that's very true . just relax both of them"
The target market of this story is not just Malaysia . Production is also from Indonesia . Want to compare with Mat Kilau is not relevant . The movie is Action/Drama . Not biographical
no cus Mat Kilau movie was
"Overated Mat Kilau has a movie . In the old days , the word ""you"" was used . Fortunately , they said not to use the word ""mat"" if it doesn't look stupid"
I watched mat kilau at the movies and that one sucked ass . Was playing with my phone the whole time . But imaginur is good not bcs it stands out from the other local movies . It genuinely has a good storyline and cinematography . It deserves a praise . Of course it's not
if you want to compare with random Malaysian movies: Sa Balik Baju is far and away the best Bunohan is far and away the best Chow Kit is the best KL Gangster is far and away the best Mat Kilau not sure Istanbul here i come! by far the best (peak Beto
"Listen to the story , this movie IMAM wants to fight Mat Kilau's narrative . But with many comments , people say the quality is far from heaven and earth (Mat Kilau more power) So , you have to see it to find out"
"Just watched Mat Kilau and Airforce The Movie . The movie that was hype before this . Yes , I'd rather watch a movie/drama late than follow the hype . For me who studies martial arts and is a palapes tudm officer and also a fan of the action genre , I enjoy every single moment of the"
Why is it that Imaginur's story doesn't get Mat Kilau's response? Malaysians like movies that are simple and don't have to think a lot
"This Imaginur movie should have received a warmer reception than Mat Kilau . But that's it , this kind of movie choice won't be very well received . Mat salleh is the same , the power movie that won the oscar , where do people see it? If you appreciate art , I really recommend Imaginur . "
They allowed all those twisted stories/narratives to scare people using racial lines and this is the consequence . Eg Mat Kilau
"I like the Mechamato series too and don't like the Mat Kilau movie . Trust my review , indeed"
"Malay: some random Hooligan: Why don't Malays take care of their own culture and throw it away for the sake of religion? Malay: make a Mat Kilau movie , do it as an effort to preserve culture Hooligans: FASCIST , RACIST , FACIST FACIST , RACIST"

"I like the hype for wahid/beto after mat kilau movie , like moon bintang and pakmat western"
"When he said the Mat Kilau is 5/5 , I can use it , he has a rating . A rocking movie can also be given 5/5"
"Who likes the movie Mat Kilau , our movie tastes are not the same . Even the tallest one is 5/10 . The script is messy , the plot is lame , the story line is too much , the actors are the best . The acting is solid , it's a pity that it's like that . "
i vividly remember when he rated mat kilau 10/10 and that movie turns out to be a disgrace to the
"Aisy: Aisy has seen Air Force The Movie , but Mat Kilau"
"When your friend just noticed you fight . Remember I'm influenced by Mat Kilau . Even though it's only been 6 years of martial arts , it's not the influence of the movie mat kilau"
"Yea , just realized the movie is called Mat Kilau , not"
Beto stole the movie more than Mat Kilau
"From wanting to watch a horror movie , to Mat Kilau then end up with"
"It beats critically acclaimed PASKAL: The Movie which had RM30 . 08 million of box office but fell short behind Mat Kilau: Kebangkitan Pahlawan at RM97 million . Then again , wiv that much of collection , the RMAF could have 7 EC-120B or 7 Bayraktar or 2 TAI Anka"
"Weiii hahaha I like to watch Mat Kilau movies but I don't even agree with your shadow cabinet , don't do that . I still support this unity government . Tired of self-centered politics"
"It seems that many Malays would like it if there were no Chinese/Indians in the government . If you don't believe it , you can go into the village or ask people who like to watch Mat Kilau movies . Most of them like that the government is 100% Malay , but they don't want to admit to being racist . It is said to dignify the nation . "
better than Mat Kilau propaganda
"Watching mat kilau for the very first time on netflix . Man . . it is shitty , but in a sense it is entertaining . Like we watch Malay dramas at 7 o'clock . We enjoy bashing on the absurdity . In a sense its like watching a b movie for the heckin fun of it . Shit movie anyways"
"Done watching Air Force the movie , sis cried when Adnan died . . sobs . . this is the best story . . compared to Mat Kilau , I feel a lot different from this Air Force , Mat Kilau is normal , this Air Force made me neves , crying , angry and scared . . "

"Each time there is an intense scene , it feels like torture , it feels like your brain is shaking like you don't see mv Mat Kilau , but this is literally brain shaking! Can't wait to see the movie"
Just watched airforce the movie for 1 minute on netflix . The cameraman makes the skill of shaking like a Mat Kilau . Don't look at it . Scared
"Btw , I rarely like Malay movies (except for the scenario of zombies , bananas , razors , lipstick goals , cun , surrender , eh , I like it lol) ok , I don't like it . But I saw thick bikerz 2 and I got hooked until the end . His fighting scene doesn't hurt"
"Although FINAS does not update the quotes on the website , here I share that Air Force is the 6th best-selling movie behind Agent Ali: The Movie (RM 30 . 05m) , Mechamato The Movie (RM35m) , Hantu Kak Limah (RM 36 . 23 j) , Munafik 2 (RM48j) & Mat Kilau (RM 97 j) . "
"Basically , Mat Kilau films are bad , just look at the reviews on movie forums . If the quality is bad , it's obvious that it's the same as the Indo market . . "
This local Air Force movie that's now on Netflix is a pile of jingoistic nonsense . 0/10 do not recommend . Also one of those Mat Kilau dudes is in
"Uh , none . I'm not really into my local movie scene , bro . Although of late I see a lotta films coming out . Weird thing the biggest show was Mat Kilau which many panned for its supremacist theme"
"Mat kilau could have been better that said is a damn good movie la , its like braveheart effect after watching it you will hate the colonials all . its not for everyone . I think the best movies so far I've watched recently was goodwill hunting on"
"So , what do you think of Matt"
"Bro , I'm not wrong , right? Haha . I mean that libhanat will blame Mat Kilau when the movie"
I remember Mat Kilau's story . . . I started a verbal war cursing non-Malays . . . non-Malays didn't watch the movie . . . didn't like the behavior
I didn't agree with the values and morals of Mat Kilau (the movie ah) and it's creator . So what did I do? I didn't watch
"Wanting to be a person who goes against the grain and get the support of many people is not an easy task . The analogy is watching movies like Mat Kilau , Phi Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani and even the PKR struggle circa 1998"
"""if you don't like it don't watch it"" - guy who wrote a 50-tweet thread about why the mat kilau movie is"
"What do I want to say how ugly and hypocritical is the attitude of all of these tribes? Then it was said that the movie Mat Kilau was racist that day , so if you follow the logic , you don't like it . "
"Is there no other argument? It's clear that the movie is only shown on netflix , not in the cinema . Try hard , it's really annoying . Call your Mat Kilau and tell me"
"It's strange that boys and young people can watch violent movies like Mat Kilau , but they can't watch soft porn movies"
It's good that the story is broken at the box office . I don't see my brother's brother wearing a woman's cloth inside
"Since I don't watch Malay movies at the cinema except for Syukur 21 & Mat Kilau , this one is easily let go , "
srsly mat kilau is a great movie? I still like to see mamat khalid have a movie . . talk fluently like studying
Mat kilau was a fucking propaganda movie and they allowed
"Mat kilau was a fucking propaganda film . . . . all this mf calling out to ban this movie due to having ""sexy"" scenes are the same guys that wack off to ms"
All the gangster movies can la . . . mat kilau was basically a propaganda movie and they fucking allowed that but this
"Hahaha , many people complain that they don't want to go to see Malay movies in the cinema . They only watched Matt"
"Chaotic timeline about the Movie . Oh well , what to say . . . our movies are full of shit , including the much-acclaimed Mat"
"You know what I find ironic about this bashing on that Pulau movie being too 'soft porn' and calling for censorship , yet I cringe when they were ayyy okay with disgusting scene in Mat Kilau where they picture the British army being violent and stomping on pregnant"
what's going on in this movie? Do you remember that there is only 1 genre of movies like Mat Kilau? make a story about hackers with more power than this softporn movie . those who do it are not Malay like me . there are Malays who do that
"If it is made for Malays like you . Address x is malaysian film forever . If you enter Indonesia , you will be cursed only by the people there . But that's movie level"
did anyone complain about paskal and Mat Kilau? those 2 movies are great level movies . people just feel annoyed by too much sexual attraction in this movie rather than
"Mat kilaau , watch the trailer first , it's the best movie ever , it's the best movie out there , it's not good , stop stifling freedom in artistic expression ie movie making , you don't need to say finas barai , it's just the same barai value doesn't run far from"
the qrts saying that it's gonna be better than Mat Kilau when both movies are
"Thanks for describing Mat Kilau yet it is the highest grossed movie in malaysia , kinda sums up mly pipol has a level of"
Is this
IF YOU MAKE A MOVIE THE Mat Kilau Mat Kilau
"Never liked his movies . I've only seen one , Mat Kilau (only for Beto Kusyairy) I hate it when the men keep saying ""lu gua lu gua"" . It's true that I directly taught you . . All time banned from me"
"Hey Mr . Syamsul Yusof , I just want to say that I've been paralyzed for 8 years and since then I liked to watch your movies , and watching all of your films especially Mat Kilau gave me the strength to get up and turn off the TV and jump out of my window , thank you"
It's good to watch Doraemon from the point of view of this movie . That day TER saw the Mat Kilau . Regret for life . I won't watch any of his movies anymore
It's like a white person said people of Malay descent won't have equal rights in their country but applauding Mat Kilau movie . Can you imagine?
Al Fatihah to Mat Kilau the OG but l'll never watch Mat Kilau the
"Bro , you see that Indonesia has movies now that are at the international level . You look at it from a different angle . It's like a special movement that looks very acting . because it looks real . Mat Kilau for me 3/5 sb like the communist idiots use weapons they can attack tgh2 the field run straight you won't die"
"those 2 devil worshipers . . disappointed giler . video review he entered in the home yt i . and he said the movie was the best , even the comments were all disapproving of him . when I watch that movie , ughh , it's not 5/5 yer pengabdi satan 1 is the best even the Mat Kilau . . it's like hauk but"
"You can stop wearing it when you watch a movie , you have to follow his taste . . Thor love and thunder are also the best and Mat Kilau 5/5 . . um"
"I haven't seen it yet , so I don't know if it's the best , but I don't think it's necessary to mention the movie"
"Different people have different tastes . If you think the Mat Kilau is 1/5 , you don't want to force people to accept it , you have an opinion . Because if that person likes the movie , it must have a high rating . Try to celebrate other people's opinions"
eimran having a mental breakdown after i told him one line from the movie mat kilau
Don't watch any Hollywood movies fr now on cuz there's high chances to be cigarettes and alcohol just stick to Mat Kilau & Disney cartoons

i would rather watch 10 hrs of M Daud Kilau dancing and singing than watching Mat Kilau hahaha step ladder action
"Me joining the hype: Never watch Mat Kilau . Even when it's on Netflix . Not because of him . Because no longer feeling the need to watch movies anymore . Used to be a movie fan , a fan of the latest movies . Now? I'd rather"
"If Mat Kilau was a good movie and money well spent then , why would the behavior of its director now make some change"
"Rarely watch his movie too , if not mistaken ""Mat Kilau"" either produced or directed by him and he's the son of Yusof Haslam , a veteran actor in Malaysian movie industry . . . dare not to register marriage here? Haha , why not if it's in accordance with sharia law and"
I can never understand people who liked Mat Kilau (the movie) . . . like . . . it's
The Mat Kilau movie is more action
"My whole family didn't see the Mat Kilau at the cinema when the movie came out . Good luck ~ netflix came out , my family didn't watch less than half because I was bored , I almost fell asleep . Don't know about that"
Today's movie sol has exceeded 97 million views and has caused the ranking of mat kilau to fall
"insane and hilarious how the director of munafik and mat kilau , both very islamic centered movies , is a munafik"
I'm the only one who feels sorry for going to the cinema to see a Mat Kilau film . you
Luckily I saw Mat
"Mat Kilau is the last movie I watched , but I still cite the OG . I've been waiting for a long time because it's the best actor , but the director is a doi la sol . . it really breaks your heart"
"I'm so thankful I didn't watch the Mat Kilau movie , I don't support you"
Mechamato please beat Mat Kilau's
"Clearly the situation here , he did not make an initial statement , as his new movie has just been launched , it lacks luster . Lps launch is proud of millions of collections . When the situation calms down , the luster of the vibe is gone , he dares to show up to make a statement for his wife"
I'm glad I don't watch that Mat Kilau
I don't really care about his gender . Those who don't know how to understand the crazy Mat Kilau movie can't get a collection of 80 million . Air Force The Movie is 10x better than Mat
"To syamsul yusoff , i would like to say your mat kilau movie is suck and same as you . And to kaza's family your whole family is"
"This movie is also the best , from moto mat to gangster mat to hypocrite mat to superstition mat to Mat Kilau , finally matrimonial mat"
"I'm proud that I didn't watch the movie Mat Kilau . It doesn't Mat Kilaur that it's about his work , it has nothing to do with his personal life . her money will never go to her mistress , because her work will spend her husband's money"
Sorry if women's emotions are disturbed but definitely no more Sol's movie in my list . Even Mat Kilau I don't see anymore . I do not know . Don't do that to your wife . Hopefully
"but when it is confirmed that syamsul is polygamous , this is the time for Sarah's daughter to file and scrape away all the marital property , support all . the latest movie he died Mat Kilau millions of income , right? rich auto baby! If I don't want to spend the night , I don't care! take the rest of my trash . "
The admin is really stupid . There is no enthusiasm at all . I'm just tired of making movies
12 . Dragon Ball Super 13 . The Assistant 14 . Mat Kilau 15 . Batman
"It's flattering movie Mat Kilau like black people flattering black panther , but lastly it's simp close to the Mat Kilau"
My bottom 3 movies of 2022: 1 . Thor: Love & Thunder 2 . Mat Kilau 3 . Black
"as far as upin ipin is concerned for huge influence , it's different if your movies , dramas or songs etc can be hyped directly here , that's the big influence . This Mat Kilau is really hyped there and here , no one sees it . not to mention other movies . where"
"""just there"" doesn't mean a lot bro :) the upin ipin , the boboiboy is okay to accept , but the others I doubt It doesn't balance if you try to compare with influences from soap operas , movies , songs etc from Indo The lack of hype in Msia doesn't work here , not to mention other movies"
"yea they should instead have a summary where u vouch for uh , top gun remake as a good movie over mat kilau and call prc human beings bio bombs in a climate of mounting sinophobia"
I think Didi And Friends the movie will beat this Mat Kilau . Hahaha hooray
"Just watched the movie J2: J Retribution . Best , good storyline and action . Good quality for Malaysia standard . Much better than Matt"
1 . Watch the movie 2 . Bungou stray dogs: dead apple 3 . matt Mat Kilau
"first time tgk Mat Kilau . 3 minutes in and I'm already heartbroken . Yes it's a fictional movie , but using Indonesians as British subordinates is so fucking funny"
It's no wonder that some people say that comeback concerts that last 30 minutes are the best . Some people are ready to say that Mat Kilau is the best Malaysian Movie . 
also just remembered this was the very last movie i've watched in the cinema before mat kilau
"I don't really like watching mat kilau movies , it's like listening to lectures . . . but hey . . people want to make any movie as long as they have an audience and they are making profit . . there are many other mat salleh movies that don't know what to do and don't get in even the mind is still stubborn , he is a person"
"Still haven't watched Mat Kilau . The passion for the costume and the true intention of the movie being published will never go away . It's a mistake , I didn't get there"
Cte air force the movie as long as it's alive is wayy better than the overhyped Mat Kilau
Gotta list all of my favorite movies of 2022 so far: 1) MechaMato Movie 2) Minions: The Rise of Gru 3) Beavis and Butthead Do The Universe 4) Mat Kilau 5) Turning
This recorder
"The quality of the movie is totally out and out , both in terms of sound and camera work , it's best because it's a historical movie , it's different"
he's been a flop the mat kilau movie was not even a good one
Literally why me and my mom boycott all of his movies including Munafik and Mat Kilau
"Later , when you go to netflix , the first thing you turn away is the comment , it's normal , this movie is blah blah blah , it's like a Mat Kilau movie"
"That day I just saw Qodrat . It's not the best , even if you already know the story line , it's like copying and pasting the story of Munafik , but it's ok . Indon has more interesting movies now . The important thing is that the camera is not dull like a Mat Kilau . Eh"
I can't elaborate a lot of movie mat
"When the Mat Kilau is a little opposite , there is no movie from outside . So easy to win too . Can't have fun not wanting an opponent from"
There is no descendants of meleis dajjal in the Indonesian government btw meleis music on spotify indon also when will it enter the top 50????? When will the movie meleis go forward? Movie Mat Kilau like controversy wkwkwkwk that's at least 1 and
Because this mechamato movie doesn't get vibes like Mat Kilau . come on support local animation
"Is there anyone who wants to do a review of the mechamato movie . . you're peeling it like an onion . Come on , come on"
"Pegiweiii . . it's so amazing that Malaysia can make animation details like that . The plot is normal . . because it's like a pinch of Marvel , a bit of DC , a bit of Kingsman , a bit of Mat Kilau . If you are interested in watching this , you can immediately spot this scene from this movie . . "
I never want to agree with the rating of the movie review mom . The Mat Kilau is rubbish . A movie that is not worth it for you to watch many times . Somehow he's still hot with people he doesn't agree with
It's normal to be influenced by Mat Kilau film . that's what he's proud of
Mat Kilau is not an IQ movie
Invite me to see Mechamato but bring up the Mat Kilau movie situation . And here comes the tweets of fans and haters condemning each taste and swearing
"Month 8?? Oh my God , isn't it the mass of us in the era of the Malay party that turned away from Islam , the best movie until the people of Kelantan watched it in Terengganu? If that's the time to end the wushu player's service , that's okay"
"Actually , you don't even have to wait for the ""movie reviewer"" to review the movie for you to see that one story . Reviewers have their own biases . Movie rating is actually personal for raters . What that person likes is not necessarily what you like . But Mat Kilau is not the best (I've never watched"
"But that's his review , so I like what he wants to say about the movie . As I looked at the Mat Kilau , I didn't really agree with the zhaf , but at the end of the day it's everyone's opinion , so accept it , he wants to say 5 stars mat Mat Kilau"
"Yes , but the situation of these two movies is quite different . Mat Klaau is viral because it has a historical connection , so many smart people are smart enough to take the port because they can talk about it (also because of SY) . Mechamato doesn't have much to talk about for going viral like MK other than it's a successful Monsta product"
"what's the fuss about this movie , just accept it , it's the middle of the movie , isn't it?"
"How many times has this store installed the Mat Kilau movie , other customers have told me to turn it off and not watch it"
"When you have mentioned 2 movies , why is one movie about noisy people and one movie about people who are not noisy . That's a comparison . It has to be realistic before comparing the elements in the movie . Mat Kilau is a historical fiction movie and Mechamato is a movie"
"""Hawa likes the History Subject after watching the Movie Mat Kilau"" . . ""Hajar likes history after mom tells stories from the 80s"" Camner wants to give children who like Math"
"If you want to fight the Mat Kilau , you have to bring a school group haha . Mat kilau got a lot of quotes because many groups came . Hope the agent of ali movie 2 can be more than rm50"
"the movie is the MUST WATCH movie in 2022 . Seriously , I'm not kidding . Even adults laugh in movies . Can Mat Kilau lose please guys?"
i know some fans kept saying its fictional and not meant to be historically accurate THEN WHY EVEN MAKE
"Mano who turned away from the ""support local"" fighters at that time , if you don't watch this mechamato movie , I'll pull your hair out"
"I just hope that their decision to vote PN is not based on Mat Kilau movie Race and religion are two easy ways to use to influence people especially the young . Could also be that these voters are people who reject corruptors in BN , ""communists"" in DAP . PN = last"
"7 . The fighting scene in this movie highlights the art of martial arts . I like & admire the way the publisher works the elements of martial arts in a modern and epic framework . If the film Mat Kilau showcases traditional martial arts , then this film is the Mat Kilau version"
Imagine if the mechamato movie came out at the same time as the Mat Kilau story . The power tho!! There are more and more people going uphill to fight
"The promise of serving the devil , all the movies are dull . . But yaya , I also wear specs . . I'm afraid that my eyes will be different . . I'm afraid to shareee"
"Mat kilau is played , chin peng is supported , si"
Remember the people who complained about the Mat Kilau movie fighting scene . Got slapped but the sound effect is like shit . Hello? Have you never seen a Tamil/Hindustan versus Tamil/Hindustan movie?? The best coat!! The sound goes first before the fist arrives . I just want to complete Mat
You know how distasteful the local movie industry is when Adi Putra (from Mat Kilau) wins best actor award at
"Thought it's gonna be Mat Kilau vs . Airforce The Movie head to head tonight , but Small Town Heroes and Spilt Gravy are the real ones"
This cabinet minister is worse than
"Yeah , maybe it's Van Gogh's that you say suck . Just like the movie Mat Kilau korg said the best . Which is . . . taste korg . Junk or Diamonds . Your happiness is money"
This movie should be the last source of reference . We will not get the image of Mat Kilau if we see the movie
"Same , I also blaspheme this movie . Even in the 2000s , movies are still bad Is your movie good? I've never watched me , I've watched it like a soap opera"
Is this some kinda dialogue from mat kilau movie . . . . . . same old rethoric been recycling
"Lol im just telling from a different perspective , for example mat kilau - how accurate is it? Or even hollywood movie black hawk down . . im not saying ur wrong , its just different"
"Kilau would hv been a wonderful movie with a correct historical narrative if the film producer , director & writer didn't throw minorities under the bus to sell an"
Goodnight Tweepies! . . . I'm tired and going to watch a movie called MAT KILAU . . 2022 . . on Netflix . have a good night and see you
"If you're Malay , just go see it , all Malaysians will watch this movie later"
any film should beat mat kilau lah . . . most overrated movie ever . and i'm a superconservative
Mat Kilau the most overrated movie ever in Malaysia . The most annoying for me is the sound effect plus the camera shaking . Is there an earthquake during the shooting? The sound effect is not realistic . I want to copy Ip Man but it doesn't work . 
Learn history from the movie Mat Kilau? Almost everything in the movie is factually wrong and messed up . Its a fictional movie btw . It's when you sleep in History class that you don't even know the federal constitution
Look at the Mat Kilau movie
"Many people diss the movie Mat Kilau . I don't think it's necessary , unless you want to criticize the film . Let's celebrate our local film"
IF THAT ANWAR MOVIE COMES OUT PLEASE MAKE IT BEAT MAT KILAU IN
"Don't provoke , but people who have turned away from religion and the PN race will never stop questioning the election of the Malay Muslim King and Agong , his supporters are still a little bit post quote movie mat kilau . Do you want to say that the Agong is selling the religion and race to Malay land himself?"
This movie I will go watch!! Mat Kilau can now be saved in the archive . Not relevant
"He is fighting for Malay supremacy and the position of Islam (this is what PN supporters say) . Anwar supports LGBT and interferes with Malay rights (according to them) . Follow the spirit of Mat Kilau from the movie (reference to PN members) , FIGHT UNTIL THE MOMENT"

"On tiktok , there is a video showing the flag , but the audio of Adi Putera is in the Mat Kilau movie . Those who agree with that video still want to live in the same place"
Forgive me too @zhafblock . Unblock me . I promise not to curse your movie taste . But it's really Mat Kilau

"<--- just got in the mood to get angry at the paid tiktok boy who allegedly ""watched the movie many times but voted ph"" . That movie"
People who were overhyped over Mat Kilau (movie) are just as stupid as the Brits (& rest of the world) who believe The Crown was treated as
"Nice story , the film is not historically correct . And then make Malays feel inferior"
when mat kilau first came out: BEST . MAKE MORE LOCAL MOVIES LIKE THIS . MALAY SPIRIT . GET IT TO 100M after mat kilau came out on netflix: this movie is not even the best . do not follow
"Tbh , I have never seen the full Mat Kilau movie . Only a quarter of the movie , so I don't know what made Brade tiktok show the sword inside"
Yusuf Azmi is one of the most wretched and bastard human beings . mat kilau is a shitty propaganda movie . Hadi Awang should be thrown into
"I don't like Mat Kilau movies , it's not because of the racism issue . . But the movie is really not the best . The first 10 minutes I didn't feel like going out"
"Wei , why arrest Muyi and others , also the Mat Kilau movie director . Because he is a person , this is all happening . Arrst them under the Act"
"This PN boy can send a Mat Kilaute vd to your brother who went viral on tiktok saying that he is Malay and has never been united , why do you want to link to another movie"
"Mat Kilau is the one to blame . If it's true that the movie is probs , supposedly the issue has arisen for a long time right after it was shown . Even after it was shown at the cinema , it received millions of collections , and it's already on netflix . Not related"
The one who chatted and looked at this Mat Kilau made me feel bad . Do not read the history of that luster other than
To make a good movie is not actually by stating all facts but to put a little bit of fiction . It is called entertainment miss . If it is a documentary yes it will be all fact . There are a lot of lessons learned in the movie mat kilau . Take it positive and learn from
"Just watched the movie Mat Kilau once , I'm already a warrior of the country , defender of religion . If I show a picture of the actual Mat Kilau and how he is , other people will believe it . "
"That movie , Mat Kilau , stirred some real problems . Factually so wrong yet so dangerous . It should be banned and its producers fined for such blatant disregard for"
"Real Deadly Violence is not like the movies , kids . It's not Mat Kilau , Bond or Superheroes . Don't play with the idea . "
"I am not suggesting any party to be corrupted . I'm saying that sometimes it is wise to keep quiet when we are uncertain . Not to mislead , create slander , and create this separation between us just like the sayings of your so loved Mat Kilau"
Finas is also one . Can you approve racist content like the Mat Kilau movie? Do you want to practice? The KKN kissing scene in the Dancer Village is said to be unethical . Apo . Your mouth doesn't burn if we say fire . 
"The fact that these boys are spreading video snippets from the movie Mat Kilau isn't it a racial issue? when people are educated about the movement with MCA , they suddenly spin and say it's not a racial issue . some of you guys are just racists and enablers and it"
It's not over to the Mat Kilau film issue

the movie itself
"Haven't seen the movie mat kilau , which I suspect is a propaganda film sponsored by people with hidden agendas . Our youths r not politically aware maybe? If yes , it would be a narrow shallow pov . They're looking for"
"honestly , I've never seen Mat Kilau's story ahhaha so I'm clueless as to what this tiktok boy is talking about Mat Kilau's movie"
"I hate those ppl r like ""mat kilau x best"" ""camera goyang ii"" if ur that professional , why don't you just record the movie? Also if u dont like the movie u dont hav to tell ppl laa . . . thats ur opinion why are you busy telling others"
"I don't see Mat Kilau is a racist movie . If you study history properly , you will know . Young generation these days really don't seem to 'research' it rather than saying 'OMG THIS MOVIE IS RACIST . DON'T WATCH"
"The Mat Kilaute movie is not wrong , but those kids who are over it are more"
"The movie doesn't Mat Kilau , but it's the boy's tiktok that over likes"
"still ppl are not focusing on how racist that movie is , pn supporters are using mat kilau the movie as an excuse to vote for abah literally most of the ppl who mentioned about mat kilau are rempits high"
Is it me or does it seem like a lot of the pro-PN racist Malays keep quoting the Mat Kilau movie as an example of why they should reject
"At this point , I think Malaysia's 10th Prime Minister is gonna be Mat Kilau The"
"You know what . I'm tired . . You complain about Malay movies x variety . . when there are historical movies like Tanda Putera Mat Kilau , you are busy trying to ban them . . If this is the case , the country's film industry wants to grow . I'm tired of seeing silly jokes about marriage"
The only good thing to come out of that Mat Kilau movie was that Ricky Gervais fried turmeric

Can you tell me the facts of the movie?
"Next time , don't make a movie with a Mat Kilau if the only result is malays being"
My father was also angry about the Mat Kilau film . p/s: he has seen that movie . so he can criticize everything
"Luckily this is the only Malaysian movie that came out . If you have 10 movies , how can you not be a tiktok boy?"
"Well , that's all I want to do with this Mat Kilau movie . There is no country"
"Yes , it's wrong , if people campaign in a healthy way and don't raise religious sentiments , won't young people be so influenced that they want to say that people don't like Mat Kilau movies , right? People who are blind to the history of people who know the movie are dull"
Repeat after me: Mat Kilau is NOT a historical movie that should be shown to young children who is not exposed or made understood of the unity of multicultural community in Malaysia prior to
"Because of Mat Kilau's story , do you have Malay blood? Lanciao , if the movie doesn't come out , it would be nice before this multi-racial hiduo . It's been decades since independence"
"If you guys don't come out with that Mat Kilau movie , you've never even heard of Mat Kilau Mat Kilau . Why do you have to look at your brother's face for what? Kemon"
I would also like to point out and reiterate AGAIN on how the MAT KILAU movie is a massive influence in giving a voice and inspire extremism and provoke racial sentiments in our
mat kilau was a god damn dangerous movie to release
"Mat Kilau is a real character , the events at Sungai Pahang happened . you want to question the dialogues , some added characters in the movie go ahead but the core of it is true . yes , our forefathers did fight colonialists for the sake of race and religion . ask your grandparents"
"""the spirit of luster!!"" they had ONE song playing the entire movie and its best described as Epic Background Music pls don't get any idea from that"
I can't blame the Mat Kilaute film tbh . bc it's relevant to that point of time . Malays were really struggling back then . don't nitpick history for your own
"I have a Mat Kilau movie bid , please . The first 10 minutes are off again . "
"Chat against people who watch Mat Kilau but vote for PH . Mat Kilau is against the colonialists . Ah fool! You know Mat Kilau from the movie , you didn't study history"
Mat Kilau you mean the sh movie not based on fact more
Don't say look at the Mat Kilau movie
"when people say that Mat Kilau film brings a bad message , you don't believe it , just watch it"
"My take is Mat Kilau is a fiction . I don't care . They can put Mat Kilau on a unicorn wearing a Superman shirt in the background of a BTS song against the Nazis , for all I care . Its a shit movie"
He
Watch the Mat Kilau movie . When arguing with slang
"HAHAHAHAH damn , I'm more than willing to go ahead and send a pm instead of looking back . Ban the wayang , at least the movie doesn't come out like that"
"* supporters bringing up the mat kilau movie as a point in argument over why PH shouldn't win as though that whole movie wasn't about micro aggression & subtle racism + stereotyping towards other races in this country , "
the isley malay people pls follow madinah's charter not that Mat Kilau movie pls look at social justice rasulullah did like that
"It's time for a movie to come out , there's a lot of people like that , "
"Movies like Mat Kilau shown to younger audiences (below 18) should be prohibited , when you are not mentally able to make sound decisions , we could see a bunch of hooligans running around stabbing and chopping"
"That's what makes me angry . Talk about history because you learn from TikTok , as far as watching Mat Kilau movie while at school you sleep during class"
ngl but this generation has some weird obsession with that Mat Kilau movie and they just want to follow the trend . Not the movie's fault . But the boy is really as long as he has something to do
"Should have seen it coming when we saw reactions to that Mat Kilau movie , "
"For a fact , I watched mat kilau and it's a very good movie! Definitely not to be applied"
That's why I dislike Mat Kilau movie and
"Try it , if Syamsul Yusuf didn't make that movie , you wouldn't even know him . Try to make PH people amazed skit with information that many people don't even know to incite . It's a non-kindergarten thing , butoh . I'm old enough , the savage can be compared to the movie . "
"But the Mat Kilau story is really funny , I just watched it . It's like 10 times I've been amused by movie mat"
That stupid Mat Kilau movie didn't help either . . it's basically our version of The Birth of a Nation urgh only instead of KKK we have racist
All
"It's funny to see that this boy is the most Mat Kilau , even the Mat Kilau movie makes my neck swell , not to mention this boy"
"To be honest , I rather watch Rise: Ini Kali Lah"
"Fuck movie Mat Kilau , it should be during the general election that day to filter who says MK movie is the best , send it away"
"When we said Mat Kilau was a bad movie because it's factually incorrect , many Malays were offended . But now , look , many young boys near Tiktok are influenced and make that movie as an inspiration of whomst to vote? And to re-ignite May 13th? What are we teaching our"
And for all young blood who are so affected by Mat kilau do your search better kids . Do not use a 2 hour movie that contains more fiction than fact as yours
I've said boy boy tiktok and mat kilau the movie
Load of crap show thru Tanda Putera n Mat Kilau movie . This is the
"This is the blood of the heroes , watch the movie , this Mat Kilau , defend the leadership of the ulama , hmmm , the attitude reflects who we are , don't blame DAP , it's already behaved like a monkey . "
"Mat Kilau this Mat Kilau that , bffr that movie is fiction . Why can't we be kind to each other without creating any racial or religious fight? I'm so worried like I don't understand why people want to fight and use unnecessary violence . Please we are all the"
After watching the movie mat kilau continue to look at the true malay fighters of those tiktok boys . 
not yet the case of Malay people we are busy updating
It has not been the case that our Malays are so busy updating about the Mat Kilau movie
M
"The previous Govt ruling should also be blamed . They should have banned Mat Kilau (movie) , which is in no way historically accurate & glorifies racial separation while portraying one race as superior & dominant . The makers should be fined heavily for trying to incite race based"
"I didn't watch the movie mat kilau trailer , I didn't watch it at all , so I don't know what it is about the movie mat kilau . I know about Mat Kilau when I was studying at school"
"Over and over again , there are movies with Mat Kilau , it's just the characters that are repeated over and over again . Because I don't even know history myself , right? Just say what is there as long as it looks like it is there"
"Seriously , people are surprised that Malaysia has many fascists . Mat Kilau is openly artless , ahistorical fascist propaganda , and it is the highest grossing Malaysian movie by a large margin . I'm surprised"
"Who once said that Mat Kilau film is just a movie , look at the impact now and how it is used"
That's why I said before that Mat Kilau movies are just entertainment . What the hell is the use of matt film for this vote?
"Who has seen Mat Kilau that many times? Look at it once , you're sick of looking at it again . Focus on other movies . Go to National Geographic , can you know that the world is wide , it's not just Malays who sit in the world"
t
"Next time watching the movie once is enough . The 3-4 times you look at that Mat Kilau , it's really a shot to your brain , even your brother's brother is dizzy , BN is falling , and you're getting dizzy"
"I saw a tiktok saying ""those who voted for ph can watch the movie again with Mat Kilau coat"" BRO THAT MOVIE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE"
Suddenly I feel like blaming Syamsul Yusof for the direction of the movie Mat Kilau when I see Tiktok of a young boy about May 13
"""watch it Mat Kilau many times"" joke on you I despise the movie with my whole heart bc the lack of proper planning , know to attack and want to fight but it seems that's how Malay"
What's so incriminating in Mat Kilau movie pls can someone let me know? I couldn't stop watching for 15 minutes
"guys , I'm sorry , sis , I don't understand because I haven't seen it yet"
"But there is a movie reviewer who supports Mat Kilau and then gets angry when people dispute his judgment , he has another backup ready"
"yes , pn supporters at ws , the status of all the quotes doesn't run out , it's the movie historically"
"And to those who use mat kilau movie as a good example , yall should really learn history with books , not"
I don't know if you watch the movie Mat Kilau and you become Malay . You are stupid because the movie is full of distorted facts . Just fiction . It's time for your History class
There is government intervention here . How bad it is . Mat Kilau and those movies alike please get banned . X brings benefits brings disadvantages
"Regardless , it's true that the Mat Kilau movie causes more harm . Many videos mention Mat Kilau . If those kind of movie is not banned and something is not done to promote fascist , it is dangerous . He won't be now but the impact will be seen many years down the line"
"Now . . . . Movie ""MAT KILAU"" WAS ONE OF"
"I'm done with the Mat Kilau , it looks like you know that because it's in the movie , right? It's not wrong , that's not what you can say . there are many more Malay figures who fought for the Malay nation . "
who can believe that this Mat Kilau movie is 100% correct
Faham that this has always been an underlying problem among Malays but i still choose to be a mat kilau movie
I will always
So this tiktok boy is apparently influenced by the movie Mat Kilau?
mat kilau not to the british opponent? I watched the wrong movie
There is also a negative side to this movie mat
"All those tiktok videos that are funny mention the movie Mat Kilau . Not the character , but the movie . Now tell me that movie wasn't an effective propaganda piece . PN should give Syamsul Yusuf some sort of"
"Kann . It really isn't just a movie . Yeee crazy gullible . I just looked at the Mat Kilau , suddenly I'm only Malay . Their eyes . Brain"
The movie mat kilau bangang is a reference . Unlucky
"In my opinion , Mat kilau makes a story that catalyzes the spirit of warriors , Le . If it is the catalyst of the nation , aduuuu . Struggle alone . In fact , a movie should not be made to awaken children's souls"
Didn't noe that patrotic movie like Mat Kilau diorang took it
M
"It's normal that the Malays are weak like that , the Chinese are all doing nothing , they're swaying . . . even lost their luster . . . people watch historical movies to learn lessons , improve and improve , not slander the nation"
and the
Movie Mat Kilau
"Yesza depa forget this is the age of the internet . The age of socmed is not the age of newspapers . Things are very easy to spread and people believe . It's true that there are good people , but it's a big mistake to show hatred towards this Malay landlord . The movie Mat Kilau is still hot . Earned"
"History has proven the fall of the Malay land because there is no unity among us , some defected but unfortunately we never want to learn from our nation's old mistakes . Watched the Mat Kilau movie many times but didn't learn the lesson . It's hard , isn't it?"
Haha . I'm sorry I didn't see the Mat Kilau many times because I can't understand from the book
"When I saw the movie Mat Kilau , I wanted to be a hero just like the people in the 2Pac song wanted to be gangsters . "
It's a waste of time for UMNO to make a movie
PN played racial cards more lmao . Mat Kilau's fight apparently that no one knows until the movie came out . Then the fear they instilled on Chinese . And then what attacking Christians in a talk? Could Muuhi be anymore
Same energy like kelantan PAS endorsing Mat Kilau movie (which is an islamofascist propaganda by isma) and tells them to go watch it as much as you can! But there is no fckig cinema in Kelantan at all! Oh the hypocrisy Only endorse entertainment that advances their agendas
There are a lot of tiktok videos
Do you think that China is a colonialist who is arguing about Mat Kilau movies? I don't understand what it has to do with our issue now
fuck this country . can't make films like we want . we are gonna resort to making films like mat kilau and other military propaganda
i
Crying over Mat kilau and visiting the Hang Tuah museum but then forget to practice the pure values in that movie . Islam teaches us to respect human right to respect the others . Respect another religions first before they respect yours . Same goes with the racism
if i see another
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
The way tiktok PN people relating politics with history subject and Mat Kilau
"Since PAS has majority seats I highly doubt that they'll just be any minister . Obviously this Hadi wants to be . Imagine . . . No more night clubs , no more concerts , no more Hollywood movies since everything has lgbt la atheism la this la that la . The watch is Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau"
They are not mature enough to think . It's just that they know how hard it is to fight movies . I don't want to be Malay
"I saw ""Mat Kilau"" movie as a horse in Chess game in this political movement . It is indeed a rally of some Malays . How much the spirit of ""Malaysianism and Islam"" is prioritized . And only show that other than Malays are enemies . Which it"
"then it doesn't run out until the Mat Kilau movie is finished . It's not the best , there's nothing to do with it"
"Gsc , tgv all here close now Just look at the Mat Kilau every 2 months In Kelantan , it's like that . When there's an event , just watch the movie and you have to die"
"Be honest ""Mat Kilau"" movie success was a mistake that PH failed to recognize . Being haunted by life like Hang Tuah , When we who refuse are labeled"
People quoting that English man from Mat Kilau movie for whatever is happening right now makes me
"""Mat Kilau"" movie Like a large Boulder swing"
A special thanks to Mat Kilau as well . That movie did wonders to
"Don't say you just enjoy looking at the Mat Kilau but don't take any notice . Such a waste of time and money . When the time comes , you can put into practice what was said in the Mat Kilau film , but it is not put into practice . Why?"
"My aunt wants to say that she is not Muslim but she wears a hijab , she wants to say that she is full but she is old , remember , auntie , don't be a traitor to your own religion , when you watch the movie , you will feel the identity of the Malay nation until you see it in the movie , when you are 15 all done"
I can already imagine more movies like mael totey mat kilau will fill
"What is your reference from the movie Mat Kilau? Wow , that's a movie . Tang Malay is watching the movie Mat Kilau . Why don't you take the movie reference Rempit to Abang Long Fadil to Bini-biniku Gangster? It's tired"
People didn't believe me when I said Mat Kilau is an anti national movie advocating Malay supremacy sentiments for the election . We've never been more divided as a
not them using Mat
Mat Kilau movie had a huge impact . It sustained a longer period in the cinemas for this to happen . As simple as that
this is all about movie mat
Every single person who thought Mat Kilau was a
"Idk if you guys realize this or not , but this GE15 has opened my eyes about the state that are majority non-Malays are voting for PH . while the Malays are having split votes . It reminds me of Mat Kilau movie , those lines about how Malay will be weakened if we are not"
Many of the Malays stay true to religion and race sentiment . Thats why Mat Kilau movie became box office although it is a meh
so you campaign using movie verses
"Maybe you can watch this malay movie name ""mat kilau"""
"In Malaysia where Kelantanese are okay drinking mud for years , the corrupt don't stand trial , Mat Kilau is a top movie , and we are surprised that Nurul Izzah is doing"
Why is his sentence the same as a Mat Kilau film?
"Tula jihoon , I've never met him until he wants to make Malaysia liberal . Tired of making Mat Kilau movies , the Malay nation is easy to forget"
"Don't be weird , Anthony Loke is going to go to see the movie Mat Kilau just to bullshit the Malays . dr daniel"
"Don't bash me for not looking at the Mat Kilau . I don't even watch TV . What drama , what movie , what netflix"
"Btw , freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of consequences . PH fights for the right to speak (FoS) , but that does not mean that the voice cannot be reprimanded / taken action (FoC) . Speech = Mat Kilau is the best movie ever Consequence = Condemned for no reason"
i just watched mat kilau bro the movie is
"Right?? In terms of culture , elements of Sume's indigenization are indeed crowned with the highest Muslims can learn a lot from this movie Even Mat Kilau"
I think Airforce movie is better than Mat Kilau . This Airforce can be served two or three times . Mat Kilau is enough to look at once
"I remember there was a movie reviewer who discussed the Malaysian demographics affecting the collection of movies . At that time , people were talking about RM 30 million as the most they could get if you take into account the audience factor on Earth . Hopefully Mat Kilau's story will attract a non-Earthly audience"
"Not yetzzzz . Will be . Mat Kilau , until now I can't finish it . There are too many feedback people . So I have already seen the movie"
"What do you want to do , even the name is lustrous , you watch a lot of movies , "
"That's my opinion . Movie Mat Kilau is very cringe . But based on movies that Indonesia has released , there are indeed many masterpieces . So , can expect"
How to block Mat Kilau on Netflix? But I'm gonna tell her netflix delete the movie
"As much as I dislike to watch mat kilau's movie , my 4y/o daughter watched it more than 100 times I think and she knew the sequence what is going to happen next . One hilarious sentence she said it out loud was ""stupid Malays"" . Hey , your son is Javanese Malay tok tok k . "

"Suspected the Mat Kilau movie was propaganda material . Didn't watch it . Who paid the RM100 million for it? Similarly , the report on TT is election material . Likewise , the pre-recorded message from the thief being aired on national TV . How much taxpayer's money"
It's insanely solid even though it cringes a little like Mat Klaau . But the only movie that The Rock doesn't have
"Fake account? Check back , I have this account since when . X main r fake2 . The court case was not settled because my boss wanted to prove that he was guilty . That's it . Very jealous of people .

"That's enough 3 . I just want to add that if you make the movie , please detail the narration a little . I didn't see that the first white person came to look for people , before that people served food . It should stand out as a piece of local Pahang cake . That's right . That's right there"

"2 . Since only Whites are referred with ""Sir"" which means ""Mister"" by most of malays nowadays , it doesn't Mat Kilaur to say that Mat Kilau movie is totally nothing more than a useless history documentation in cinemas . They should refer to them as ""mister"" (encik) , no more ""sir"""

It's not political propaganda i hate mat kilau film also because the quality as a movie i grow up watching bllywood and tllywood every friday n sunday most of the time villain is muslim we don't condemn it's as racist it just a movie even do we know Muslim in India is

"This low-key gore Mat Kilau film is also actually true . When the British soldiers were ambushed , there were also many violent scenes that were not suitable for children"
"""Mat kilau is a propaganda movie to villainize other races"" statement Said by Chinese/Indian = almost 0 Said by Malays = A lot Malay = Make"
Me and my girls watched Mat Kilau for the first few minutes and then we changed it to something else . Not because the movie was bad . . but those kids getting shot was just too
"Movies! Buffalo Boys , and Mat Kilau! Indonesian and Malaysian"
"still amazed when I watched it for the first time on netflix . For me , the biggest reason why the movie Mat Kilau is successful is that it is a historical movie genre that is not cliche like a typical Malay movie . As a regular viewer , I enjoy it but there is a lot of room for improvement that we should accept that it is"
"That day , people made a fuss about Mat Kilau blah blah blah blah . I think it's like Mat Kilau , this cult movie . I just watched it on Netflix . Looks like these previews are too much . Want to accuse the preview/review of bribery , there is no proof . I suspect that"
"thoughts on Mat Kilau 1 . it has everything that i absolutely hate in a syamsul yusof movie (TERRIBLE sound mixing , migraine inducing shaky camera , annoying timing for slow motions and zoom ins) there r some neat shots tho 2 . fight choreography was cool 3 . "
"my point is: just because it's a historical movie about our local hero , doesn't mean it's a good one . there's still room for improvement though . i hope the next movie about our hero will be much better than mat"
i didnt have any expectations for abang long fadil 3 so it was an average movie for me but the cinematography and camera work for the actions are better than some (mat
"But there is a basis , somebody with a big idea , find funds and make a movie that can beat Mat Kilau's sales . It's not true , I don't really want to support the Mat Kilau movie , but if there is a better idea , use a better technique or technology , and beat the success of the Mat Kilau movie"
"All the noise about Mat Kilau , sis , I want to share it . Just watch it once , it's ok if you want to repeat it . This movie reminds me of special moves + hypocrisy hmm eeeii I'm not good at reviewing movies"
Movie Mat Kilau is not wrong . i
I don't understand why some Malays are unable to understand Mat Kilau movie deeply . Some of them believed we should againts opposition nowadays but infact we should unite againts the Malay government that we have now This is a clear and accurate description down to the hole
Mat Kilau on Netflix seems like a different experience compared to watching in theater . Watching it in theater the speaker is so loud and loud and loud but in netflix it feels like a normal sound
"I'm Malay . Malay movies I watch . Even drama . Malay songs I heard . A lot of bass . I celebrate Raya because I am Muslim , not because I follow the Malay tradition (Ramadan ofkos , I fast; it is obligatory for me) . But this Mat Kilau movie is not possible . Cam haghammm"
"But the script , plot , the cinematography , the camera work etc . Its just not that good as how ppl make it sounds like . Cause honestly , this aint the first malaysian movie with such historical theme but im pretty sure i can name few old movie that is way better than mat"

"That's what for me , making a Mat Kilau film is really out in terms of making a lot of angles out , but what is he trying to convey to the audience that there aren't many Malaysian directors who want to make this historical movie and also raise the Malay spirit of young people instead of"
"That's syamsul yusof , why did he get the script , the movie became a commercial success because of the legendary name , if it wasn't for Mat Kilau , already"
"One of the strong parts from the movie Mat Kilau is the story that he never gets bored . Even there are a lot of significant dialog and technical problems , but it's a good start to produce a local historical movie that doesn't get boring even if other historical movies are technically good . That's why there are two types"
"Duh , the one who just saw Mat Kilau is so tired to complain . Look at it . Just enjoy the movie . The name is also 'inspired' by historical stories . It's just a story . Nervous"
"Mat kilau doesn't meet my expectations , I was looking forward for a movie with a classic style of language like in puteri gunung ledang , but he has dialogue like the times of today , I don't know what's so hype , for me it's normal , I still like meron mahawangsa n princess"
Just watched Mat Kilau and can't brain how few Malay nation failed to acknowledge the history . Forget your cinematography it is still watchable and educational . Without the movie I doubt they would read on Mat
I can watch Mat Kilau . I can stand stupid movie from David Teo . I'm a movie
"Abistu has already reviewed the movie that he gave is a bad movie . It's a Mat Kilau film , so you can't say it's bad"
"Why is it that when Mat Kilau came out , there were not many people condemning the movie , what's the point of the camera , once you enter netflix , there are a lot of people"

"The amount of people complaining about mat kilau makes me wonder , how many times have movie fans seen it at the cinema until it reached the biggest box office in Malaysia? How many plaques are stingy waiting for netflix kua"
"Eee , how is tiber siott . . how did he turn to malay . . when did he argue about the history of malay people . . he just commented about the movie instead of the Mat Kilau itself . . please don't embarrass yourself here . . you really lack on reading comprehension . . a lot of reading"
"The moral value that I can get from this Mat Kilau movie is a sentence spoken by Mat Kilau at the end of the movie . ""The important thing in the struggle is to fight for God . Not to fight solely because of race and"
"I've seen Mat Kilau on nexflix . Overall it is a good movie . Even though some people say that the script is boring , if you really understand the meaning behind the script , you will understand . It's normal that people are not the same . I don't blame them . Everyone has an opinion"
Like what u need to watch from cinema first to get it or whatt comeon just support it its not harmful plus u pay for neftlix u can watch a lot of movie its not like u pay only to watch mat kilau but the people that watch it from cinema they pay only for mat
Okay but what type of dialogue that you guys expect for Mat Kilau huh i dont understand this folks and i saw some that waiting for a big plot what??? Comeon its a historical movie . . . . if you want to watch it then watch it if you are not interested then
"Mat Kilau's critics/reviews should've been a week tops after the movie was released , not after it was shown on"
I'm really lazy to watch the power comment about the Mat Kilau movie . I don't even know what you expect in the story
"Done look at Mat Kilau . Fast storyline . Malay clothes are not worn , they should be worn before they are real . the movie filter is too bright . The character & impact of Wahid (Beto)â€” makes Mat Kilau's story more palatable . "
"Those who have watched mat kilau on Netflix , then there are those who are not satisfied , why don't you be like that . . if you want to be satisfied , watch the movie . . that's the right feeling , watch mat kilau . . I've watched it 4 times already I want to see it again but later"
"Poor and stingy people just want to watch Mat Kilau on Netflix . Org has seen the film on cinema for a long time , he just wants to make noise because he is a movie reviewer"
">People complaining about that Mat Kilau movie Oh , now you wanna complain? The movie was out 3 months ago . . where the fuck were you fucks"
"I rarely go crazy watching Malay movies . I love romance movies and malay romance cringe crazy usually . I saw Mat Kilau's story at the cinema that day . Honestly , I'd watch the movie over and over again . I admit Kilau's character does not need to be very serious to the point he looks"
Love or hate Mat Kilau thats on you . Idc about that movie . But if I decide to watch it and its shit . Imma judge yall Mat Kilau fan taste in
"The thing is the Mat Kilau thingy . Why are people so torn? . . . isn't that a movie? Can't we just enjoy watching something?? Aren't movies or films something we watch to escape reality? If u like it thn like it , if u dont thn stfu . Historical is not historical just a thing"
"It's true what they said in the movie Mat Kilau , you can think it's just a story to entertain but take it so seriously that every day you want"
"i dont get how mat kilau's movie is getting a lot of shit , it's true what syers said , malay broke"

How can you think of watching the movie Mat Kilau
Movies to watch: - Private Sweep - Mat Kilau - Ek Villain Returns - Princess of the Mountain
Why can't you curse Mat Kilau film? Other movies are not even curse-proof . Every movie deserves to be
"I'm ok with the movie Mat Kilau , only if the opponents act like KL Gangster . Just make it normal . But because the market here likes rival stories , the heavy biography genre is how well it sells"
"I want to talk about Mat Kilau . That movie is an over-budget theater performance that lacks depth and plot . I also want to talk about Abang Long Fadil 3 . That movie was fun , silly and beautiful"
"Hahaha , it seems that after watching the movie , you didn't read the real history of Mat Kilau . So please shut up . Because the more you sound the more you appear to be one of the people who failed the history subject first . *I've seen the movie and it's still a failure"
"Everyone wants to come out looking knowledgeable . For me , it's okay to have a Mat Kilau movie . . It's not as bad as that one"
"brain fall? where is netflis free , as far as Mat Kilau , it's a grade c movie"
"Watch the movie PUTERI GUNUNG LEDANG . big gap from Mat Kilau . The type of images , the style of conversation , the way the story is told . . . the difference . . 2004 vs 2022 , the difference between the 2004 film and the 5"
"Look , I'm not hoping for The Imitation Game level of history-biographical movie , but since the title itself is called Mat Kilau . . we should at least get to see a character arc of Mat Kilau rather than just this righteous figure who is clever bersilat that we're"
movies
Can you not defend Mat's movie?
"Dude can't even tell how criticism works like then we say that mostly people condemn the scripts and how to record videos , it has nothing to do with the budget . No one talks about the budget . If you think Mat kilau can be better , give your suggestion to make the movie even"
Mat Kilau as a movie yes But the real history of the man is not an insult Malay Culture=/Malay
"im malay Maybe more Malay than you or the rest . But I will never watch Mat Kilau because 1 . Just another shitty movie . 2 . Actor Adi Putra is hardcore UMNO ass licker 3 . This is a propaganda film . 4 . With ticket sales 100m , show how fuxxed up malay"
Mat Kilau is the worst
"man it's dangerous to say i don't like things anymore not liking Mat Kilau the movie are prone to get attacked it's a fiction , a movie and this is social media we get to say what we like about the movie or not why are we being sensitive"
"I've already talked about 6 people shooting 1 , bro , even Fast and Furious can jump buildings using a car . If you want to make a movie , there's a point . If you want to use logic , don't look at the Mat Kilau , look at National Geographic , that's all there , bro . "
"Compared to movies in the country , there is still a lot of shortages , Merongmahawangsa , Lieutenant Adnan , Bukit Kepong , he has cinematography , dialogue and storyline that are not brilliant but we as viewers are not bored watching and enjoy the movie"
As history movie lover I'm approved Mat Kilau . Sis
"The local movie , Mat Kilau just went from 'best' in the cinemas to 'teruk' on Netflix . Different categories of audiences with different expectations? Or the movie is average? Haven't watched it yet - will wait for it on"
"Ok done , watch a little Mat Kilau movie near the pc monitor . During the fighting scene . Dizziness . People's cameras don't have a stabilizer on their phones so they shake"
"Just watching Mat Kilau . Very cool movie , it is easy to understand and talk about . Definitely not for starbucks folks , but for teh tarik drinkers this is some topic and maybe a start to you know , way to move forward . We are too comfortable to appreciate it"
"It's good to make a trap in the forest , suddenly the British can come out recklessly like that . I feel angry when I watch Mat Kilau movies"
"people are rowdy not because of that luster , but"
"Mat Kilau is fucking ass . The cast , script , production , sound effects , etc . But at least our Malay friends finally have a local superhero movie for themselves . Not surprised why they're all"
"Calling Mat Kilau a propaganda movie is giving a bit too much credit . Good propaganda movies rely on less lazy writing , if nothing else . Its makers were so lazy they had turbaned Sikh soldiers speaking in Hindi . Like , what?! Even in fiction , this bit is just"
"Aah bro , I pay for netflix and the fastest wifi 120 is really just for Mat Kilau . Hundreds of other movies on netflix don't get a single cent . I don't even use my wifi for other things . . I just go back to the cave bro , that's it"
"Mat Kilau the movie had the big disclaimer that it was a work of fiction at the beginning (on Netflix anyway) , while the ""memorial note"" ensures the viewer is aware this is a historical figure . Conflating nationalism , fact , and fiction is the real movie , starring us , "
"Okay , that's enough . Muting the word Mat Kilau because you fucks are annoying as fuck . Movie is shit , deal with it . There is no heavenly reward for that"
"I don't hate the Mat Kilau movie , I just think"
He clearly said that the movie is fiction and inspired by Mat Kilau . What kind of history is it if from start to finish you fight by talking without looking at the camera
Seeing everyone's Mat Kilau reviews and realizing I couldn't make it past the first 5 minutes . These people who lasted the entire movie are people of great resilience and powerful ability to hate-watch something with such
The stupidest rant award on twitter goes to
"""The film Mat Kilau is not made in the Pahang accent , there are many disputes , but the movies Lion King , Finding Nemo , there are no language disputes"
"""The film Mat Kilau is not made in the Pahang accent , there are many disputes , but the movies Lion King , Finding Nemo , there are no language disputes"
"It's deaf against this Mat Kilau Mat Kilau fans . If you don't like it , don't bother watching it . Don't be a demon inciting other people , don't bother watching . Not everyone is interested in Avengers . And not everyone is interested in Mat Kilau . Do you understand? There are many other movies you can watch"
"Netflix's Mat Kilau issue is like this . Many of our people cannot allow other people to have different personal opinions . I don't like one Msia band , I have to chop it up . I don't like the movie Mat Kilau , no"
"As for Dato Maharajalela's movie , I hope to add more camera shake , which is Mat Kilau"
"It's like Netflix has a Mat Kilau story . If you don't like it , watch another movie . What's your IP?"
Right . . that's what I don't understand anti-Mat Kilaute fans . Ready to mention other movies like It's like anti
What do you do when it feels like nothing else can be watched on Netflix? Not Mat Kilau movie . 
"The script is so cringe , so funny as the talk . I patted my head the most when the part of the British colonists had a lecture about the weakness of the Malays in front of the mat kilau when they were first attacked by the tuyuk , what are the British in the movie?"
Done look at Mat Kilau . His story is not bad . Camera shaking? That's because the scene is suspended indeed . You will find a lot of shaking cameras in any action scene movie . It's in the Avengers too
i think mat kilau was good for a local movie idk why y'all are so pressed abt
"There is no issue with this Mat Kilau . It's even the name of the movie . If all of a sudden Syamsul Yusuf wants to make everyone in there write poetry , the dagger has power , Mat Kilau can fly , there is Ismail Sabri from the future to help Mat Kilau , all that is possible"
"Everyone talked about Mat Kilau , but if someone wants to make a movie , I live and fight to see Henry Golding so"
"why don't the people who judge the Mat Kilau movie really relax , you tell the story of a bored omputih , you don't want to judge 14 days and 14 nights . This story has been going on for a long time , why are you up again? triggered because of many support and"
The luster of a die-hard movie
"I just saw the Mat Kilau before I think the movie is ok . A movie about Malay history , right? History is like that , it can be changed at will . What you want to show is"
Mat Kilau is a flop in my books . I dosed off . PAS-centric . Silat is a beautiful art but unnecessary camera movements my eyes ached . camera movement was the best . Weak storyline . is still the best in terms of periodic-ish local movies like
"I don't like Mat Kilau's story , pro colonialists say If you like Mat Kilau's story , he says that we have a bad taste in movies Enough"
I will not pay monthly just to see Mat Kilau . Must want to watch the drama
Doesn't Mat Kilaur . It still beat mat kilau in the box office . Not sure why you are going with % of watchers when your main claim is that no Punjabi movie beat mat kilau in box office . I gave you evidence and you did the favor to embarrass yourself . Really failed to reply
There's no end to the chatter about the Mat Kilau movie
"There is nothing free . . Even the monthly is still paid . . . . I pay rm 55 to subscribe to netflix . . Like I pay rm 55 for every 1 movie on netflix . . . If I don't see that Mat Kilau once , I pay rm 55 to see Mat Kilau . . If I see 10 times , I will pay rm 5 . 5 . . Phm"
"Haha , with a huge Indian population still cannot beat Mat Kilau . Nobody watches"
"The feeling of watching Mat Kilau at the cinema is different if you compare it to Netflix . At the movie , I feel like it's not bad . When I look back on Netflix , it feels like a movie trash"
"The Mat Kilau is bad . Story line , fight scene , script / dialogue are too corny . Can the 100 million be scammed? It was too hard to watch after 30 minutes into it . Was laughing and cringing throughout the movie . There are lots of great malay movies . This aunt"
Many have negative comments about the movie Mat Kilau . The difference between watching
"Mat Kilau is , without a doubt , a horrible movie . Individuals who enjoy it have a low standard for film quality . That concludes the"
In vain Mat Kilau fought to defend religion & homeland only for the modern generation to lower the flag at half-mast to respect the former colonialists . That's the correct sentence . People want to chat about movies
"Real idiot Sikhs . 30% inflation? Haha . Your grandfather from the movie Mat Kilau taught you ah pundek? Hindi movie u claim to b Punjabi , indeed all Sikhs"
"Mat Kilau is 8/10 for me but I wish they could have removed 90% of the preaching in the movie . You can say sincere because of Allah but don't say things in the line of ""destroy oppressors , protect Malay land for Allah"" etc . I don't see Allah plays deus ex machina in your"
"What's the fuss for days about the Mat Kilau movie? That's it , Malaysians"
"Even watching Netflix is paid , but in Netflix there is not only Mat Kilau , there are many other movies . . if you don't want to watch , you can watch other movies , if it's a legitimate movie , we only pay to watch that story . . so the tweeter said watch I understand the meaning of Netflix free"
"Why did many people hit the Mat Kilau after it was shown on netflix? Was it the greatest movie on earth? Definitely no . But I did enjoy it despite the plot that was so meh . Maybe the experience at the movie theater and TV is different , but at the movie theater , it's in the right mood . "
this mat kilau discourse is so lame like u can like a movie and still admit that it's
"He's like you are a fan of Thor movies . I'm a fan of Mat Kilau stories . When a lot of people curse on Twitter about Thor's story , do you get angry? ""Thor is the worst movie I've even seen . . "" like that . Like what they did to Mat Kilau . And not for a full explanation . I'm more interested in the story line"
Watched Mat Kilau for like 10 mins then went to sleep . I was like this movie to talk
"I'm angry . Because I think the story of Thor Thunder & Love is not the best , I will not curse on Twitter . But , when it's a Malay story . . it doesn't Mat Kilau . You will judge . . it's not fair , right? Judge is the worst movie . But don't even explain"
I think Mat Kilau will throw up watching the movie
"people don't make a lot of noise about cite Mat Kilau . I'm not weird . Like seriously , is there a Malay movie that I don't think is the best? nothing like that"
"It's enough if you want to make all logical movies . Even the name is fiction . If the soldier shoots at one time , the movie is only 15 minutes long . It became a short film . Fighting scene over so much? Part of it sounds , but imagine kicking without sound , it looks like action"
"Many local movies are the best . But Mat Kilau is not the best . Also , created by Malay supremacists . After that , I'm smart enough to think for myself , I don't want to be told"
"Those who curse this Mat Kilau film really hate the way of tweeting . It's like just watching the worst movie in my life . Maybe cursing people are trending , so many people join the party to get likes and retweets"
"The problem is correct . If it's a hollywood story , release the same scene as in the Mat Kilau . This tribe does not want to condemn . When it's a Malay movie , you quickly tweet all the things you don't like , and you're happy to say that Malays can't be touched , so you're weak because you want to insult Malays . "
"ah you , if Mat Kilau dies early , it won't be a Mat Kilau movie , you're so stupid , you want to follow your logic"
Fighting scenes in Mat Kilau movie was a
"Why are so many people suddenly arguing over Mat Kilau? I still think it was a fantastic movie , I don't care what other people say . When a movie manages to make you feel strongly emotional about something , for me it is a definite success , despite its probable"
Really bitter twitter boy with Mat Kilau . There is no psal in the movie but he is bitter with his own people ahhaha . Pity . Born Malay can change to another race
"why are peoples in twitter are so pressed about Mat Kilau movie? the cinematic was great , the sound and so on , what do you guys want? chat about dialogue , what do you want to get into? just enjoy the movie , don't like to be silent . you guys tweeting shits here again bringing down the industry"
"Mat Kilau is great for debates even on the storyboard , there are people chatting who say what movie is there sb . Well , sadly , not all of them are in Msia , bro . Haha but a good director always has their own notes on his script . If it's like kabir , he makes a ready shot list for every scene in the script"
"Repeat after me . . ""MAT KILAU IS NOT A HISTORY MOVIE . "
"Seriously arguing about the Mat Kilau movie at TL . To be honest , I gave less than 5 stars . From start to finish , I can't find any factors"
"Am I the only one who doesn't watch this Mat Kilau? Hahahaha Alhamdulillah , you guys have already watched it and are ready to give feedback like you guys , you have time to watch the movie . My Netflix is also dusty , because no one wants to rummage through what movies it's best because there isn't any"
What a waste of your life if the movie doesn't Mat Kilau and you want to debate . 
There are a lot of famous Twitter clans tweeting about Mat Kilau . Even the liberal Malays on Twitter conspired to condemn the movie
"Who is interested in watching Mat Kilau movie , don't force people who are not interested to be interested . Those who are not interested in watching Mat Kilau , don't force interested people not to be interested . That's just a story for me . Designed and created for film . Some like it , some don't like it . "
It's crazy that Mat Kilau movies can be a debate here and there (can't find the popcorn emoji . Corn too
"for me . . it's the best thing . . I didn't see it at the movie , I still feel it . . then twice I saw it on netflix . . for me , its ok . . where is the perfect movie . we as humans are not perfect , this is a movie . Historical movies are boring . over ja malaysian netizens"
"Our views will always be different . The important thing is to ""keep going"" to produce a movie that benefits the community . Good job team Matt"
"At first , I didn't see the Mat Kilau at GSC , it's strange why the language is not right , but when you think about the logic of the spa language , you still want to use it for movies , you want to use b . baku , it's illegal for people to understand , right? I want to read the subs , I want to feel the scenes again . . I just got it . . Last , if you want to make a whole movie , use that language"
"Now you won't believe how much American Political Agenda was shot in that movie but the story is pretty much shit through and through . The reason for its success is simple , Giant Transforming Robots Fight Each Other . Same goes with Matt"
I wonder what you want to fight so much about
"Hats off to netizens who only watch Mat Kilau on Netflix and criticize the movie . In netflix , there was a lot of trash movies before this , but I didn't raise high reviews , even though I watched many of them with similar storylines"
"(In my opinion) Mat Kilau is ok if you want to see it , but it's not as good as it is hyped . There are still many flaws . But anyway , this movie is still successful in terms of"
"Pd I , not only experts are eligible to comment . Maybe yes , he is not a film maker , but he always watches other people's movies and works to have enough benchmarks vs the hype . Eg , I am a copywriter by profession . But as I watch manyyyyy movies , I think Mat Kilau's presentation is still not umph , much"
"After this , if there is a movie like Mat Kilau , I will wait for netflix"
Why? Because paskal looks too personal . Mat Kilau may be too flashy and not to my preference . The Air Force brings goosebumps . It seems that the struggle to escape from terrorists and the personal character element does not overshadow the patriotism element of the
Gosh!! I can't stand it . . . I feel nauseous and continue to breastfeed my child while watching a movie
"What's wrong with mat kilau . . haiyaaaaa . . do you want a movie level like hollywood to mat? Haaa , I'm going to make a movie , will you see . . until it gets 10k collections? Erghhh . . so many songsehh"
10 mins
"You're just a member of Netflix , you don't pay us , we pay for two months and free info for you bro , Netflix buys the movie Mat Kilau so its not FREE"
For me cite Mat Kilau is not perfect but to label this movie as bad is like not agreeing a little . . Who says this is bad I can say that people have very high expectations . . With collections up to 97 million so people remember cite Mat Kilau very much perfect &
"The Mat Kilau is decent . Best action , just love the camera , God . His dialogue is not very good but still shocked to see a Malay movie like this . 3/5 After this another hero"

"Anywaysss it's not bad , it's Mat Kilau and I don't understand why people give bad reviews but yeah it's people's opinions and yes I do think they still have a lot of room for improvements . I'm proud that msians are now taking steps to produce this kind of movie more than the rempit one so"
"We don't condemn Mat Kilau films for nothing , but for the people in the industry to improve their products because we want to make high quality films which our neighbors Thailand and Indonesia have been doing for the past 15-20 years . Please learn , won't you?"
It's a good feeling to watch a Mat Kilau movie with another netflix . That's why a lot of people say it's not the best when watching netflix Mat Kilau movies

It's noisier than this Mat Kilau movie . It sounds the same over and over again . . not appetizing to the
Mat kilau is one of it if you want a bad movie . Bad performance maybe
Mat kilau is a decent movie but the sound effect wow
"The best thing is what's bad , even if it's bad , at least this Mat Kilau can come to teaching , then it's easy for students to understand history instead of reading and memorizing from textbooks . Those who feel bad go make movies"
It's sad to see so many people review this Mat Kilau film . No one is forcing you to watch it
"Every line in the script is like a religious/political talk . His action scene is ok . At this stage , the Msia audience says it's the best? A lot of people say don't compare with Hollywood , Bollywood etc etc but shouldn't we compare with the best so that we can improve? Mat Kilau"
Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa is the standard of Malay hero movies . Mat Kilau is literally a
"I don't know . Mat Kilau stays 9/10 . One of the best movies that has been brilliant for me . With the actors & sentences that were thrown all A+ & hit my soul . Other people want to curse , curse . But Don't ""Insult"""
"Damn , they are fighting about Mat Kilau again . He was fighting about the movie that was playing at the cinema"
"My mom reacted to the Mat Kilau movie: The story is okay , I enjoyed watching it . But the opponent's part , the camera is terrible . For me , I am like my mom . It's also fun to watch"
"It's not about matt kilau criticizing xbest . zhaf . . . don't criticize the movie please , don't insult taste"
"this mat kilau argument , the movie was good if u compared it to any other malaysian movies but nothing rly that astounding or extra-ordinary abt that movie . it was cringe thru n"
"Whatever it is , Mat Kilau is the most commercially successful film in Malaysia to date . Syamsul Yusof played to his strength (he knows he can't art berat movie) and really knows his"
I want to curse the movie Mat Kilau . Don't curse Beto Kusyairy . I fought until the end
I don't want to defend and condemn more fictional movies whose characters are just coincidences with history . Fictional . Rekaan . We should not even care if Mat Kilau is wearing a superman shirt riding a dinosaur against the British while singing a song
Why are people bashing this Mat Kilaute film? Are your expectations high to the seventh heaven? The gist is not much but it's such a good movie to
"The one that turns me off is this Mat Kilau , I see a lot of chatter but there is no content , I just want to check . Apparently the lesson you got from the movie is gonna mute this , have fun swearing in me"
It's also funny the fanatics who can't see people commenting on the Mat Kilau movie like this movie determines Malay sovereignty . Technical critics and pushy scripts . Each POV . Do you want a story that lifts silat and the script is okay but the budget is way lower but a good movie? My take is
I'm glad I didn't watch Mat Kilau on the Cinema . I don't like it . I hope future movies will improve
"Wanted to watch it on netflix , but read on twitter many people regret watching it . I'm sorry I didn't go to the theater . . well I watched the movie 365 days part"
Okay
"okay , just finished looking at the Mat Kilau . the movie was good 7/10 . if I'm syamsul yusof's sister , it's best to be able to comment on where to touch up for the audience to get what they want when watching a movie"
muted 'mat kilau' forever because I checked tweets fighting about the movie . what's stupid??? not
Wehh what people hype is so dull ehh i just watched it and I don't understand what makes people hype it that much . It's a great movie tho but gosh the acting is
Might rewatch Mat Kilau since a lot of people came to see what I've missed during my first viewing near the stage . Before the rewatch I gave the movie a hensem/10 which can translate to a high
"I wonder how many days people on twitter want to fight about this Mat Kilau movie? That day , when I went out on stage , there was already a row . . this continued the row . not"
"When I first watched the movie , I was hoping it was Mat Kilau . Man gave a fantastic performance alongside Adi"
"Why is there so much hate on Mat Kilau? Chill bro , it's not normal to watch brain shutdown movies at any moment , Rokiah brother"
"Tgk Comment , it's true that the film has a Mat Kilau finish , but the Malay people are divided . This movie is also a rowdy alliance . "
"What do you expect this Malaysian film to be wow wow? People are amazed by Mat Kilau movies because Malaysia doesn't always have movies like that . But if you expect that there is no error , it is a big mistake"
"Match the emotional hang name lol . That day , Zhaf cursed the yellow girl , you said it was her right as a ticket-paying audience to comment on the movie , what's the point of criticizing it , she insulted me even more . I'm criticizing and getting criticized by Mat Kilau fans . Hypocrite"
"It's fun to curse the movie Mat Kilau . I'm quite happy that someone is willing to make a movie about a historical figure , not an influencer , a drug kingpin who speaks Malay plates , a rich family who wants to pay for it , a slapstick comedy that has no direction"
who turned away Malay butthurt crazy people
"As a movie lover , I hope the government does not sponsor historical movies and give exclusive contracts to Syamsul Yusuf . He's good but not good enough . Movie Mat Kilau was a disappointment . The good things about that movie are the actors , props , n choreography (excluding camera"
"To me the movie Mat Kilau is okay . Nothing to hate on . Lines are a bit cheesy tho . Color grading was off in some shots . Cameraworks is a little bad , not much . Tears were"
"why are people suddenly condemning this Mat Kilau movie? i watched it on cinema n i enjoyed it . it feels like it straight coming out of history textbook + the ending is ""tergantung"" i heard from somewhere that the actual Mat Kilau ran away after they won the fight? idk maybe tht was the"
"forget about negative comments on Mat Kilau's movie , I promise my men are all big fans of mat kilau , if you see them , you must do mat kilau stunts , ready to memorize the dialogue"
"I've seen Mat Kilau when he praises it soar . Expectations are high . Last2 . I want to comment on the movie , first time there are many comments"
I am so thankful for not seeing in the theater Thank you for publishing Mat Kilau and helping me by not wasting my money watching the movie
Decided to give Mat Kilau a chance . Waste of 30 minutes of my time that I can't get back . Wooden acting with poor cinematography . Even the action sequences from the 80's movies are better . Just lazy writing with poor
"Personally , I don't like watching movies and TV shows . But I like the sentiment of the Mat Kilau story that brings the spirit of Malay identity and other noble values . I like to see a lot of happy families together , use the ramp to see , young people have the passion to know history , interest"
So there are people who record full movies on netflix and publicly post them on YouTube . Where is the morality when you are against
"mat kilau's story (not the movie) is inspirational and should've been done right in the movie , bcs i am not feeling the malay propaganda in this"
"because I already know the story line & the sound at my house is not as good as in the movie . I will never watch a movie that I didn't understand the first time . I watched it again just once . I think it's best because I already know the storyline & I like it because I understand it , but it's upside down , people don't"
"If you don't see it , then why don't you believe the movie review on twitter? It's like people who force you to see the movie . If you don't meet your expectations , like other people , that's my opinion . X don't blame people's reviews . "
Just got back home & caught my dad watching mat kilau again for the 2nd time . . He likes it . . He usually watches action western movie at Netflix only but now its malay time hehhe The movie not boring he said . . complete package . . 
"I think it's time for the movie to die , there are people who condemn this movie , but at that time they all backed up and hit you . It's normal when you watch it back on TV , you'll be criticized because when you first saw it , you had high expectations and excitement . when I watch it the second time , I will like this movie"
Why are the gangs of gangs who are angry about Mat Kilau being criticized? Are you the one who benefits from this movie or do you feel that the dignity of your nation and country is being challenged? Criticism This can be used as a step to further improve the level of our film industry . We already know there is potential
"This Mat Kilau story can be a type of investigative film . Detective movie . Find out who is the defector of Malay officials . At the end , Mat Kilau seems to have sacrificed himself for Pahang's victory , but the final scene shows him living in the forest . The black shirt with the raspy voice is there , all that's left is the mask . . . "
Butoh . Thank you 21 best coat . Mat Kilau is a movie
"Casting for omputeh roles is inexplicably bad . WTF . Sikh soldiers are portrayed as one-dimensional sadists . Mat Kilau is political propaganda wrapped in a morality play â€” given the movie's cultural impact , a longer essay on this might be"
"Hahaha every month he subscribes not just to watch one story , not Mat Kilau but the movie on Netflix . I don't even have netflix free . But when you think about it , people want to wait for Netflix because they want to chill and save money"
In vain Mat Kilau fights to defend religion & homeland only for the modern generation to argue about
"Every commenter is persistent and makes a long thread about this Mat Kilau It's just a movie . In the movie , even cows fly to death . Are you really confused? Chill"
"How are you triggered when people comment that they don't like the movie Mat Kilau? If you're Malay , do you have to like the movie? Chill it . It's just a movie . The best comments about the movie"
"whatever twitter ppl said , i still like Mat Kilau glitter cuz im pretty simple . if i enjoyed the movie then i like it"
"Reading the comments on a channel that uploaded the full movie Mat Kilau (now private) really hurt . Ready to pray for cheap sustenance , go to hell"
"For me , as long as I wear the tangak & like the Mat Kilau film , it's not enough to emphasize the Malaysianness . If you really want to be Malay totok , you have to learn all kinds of Malay dialects . It's a lively chat like Malay , but I don't understand all the Malay dialects that exist , ready to curse between"
"it's called ""mat kilau pahangan pahlawan"" but i don't see mat kilau BANGKIT , from the beginning he was a pro . i also believe the only reason malays were so quick to love it was because of how narrow our range of malay movies/dramas are . Kudos to kemba studio for this"
"I've seen Mat Kilau near Netflix . How can they collect hundreds of millions of ringgit when the quality of the soap opera story is better than this movie . Oh yes forget , who saw all the Palawans climbing the Malay Nazi Supremacy . Bani's life"
"It's a lot of fun watching this Mat Kilau movie . People's interests are different , right? I give"
Watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . For me the main weakness of the movie is that it did not do a good job in telling the history of Mat Kilau . It feels like a generic silat movie set during the British occupation . Who is Mat Kilau? How did he become a
Too much cinematography and character development critics for Mat Kilau movie . But for me just enjoy the movie . Just chill
"Have your own opinion . . about this Mat Kilau . . at least there is anger towards the colonialists . . that's good enough . . sometimes these tribes are one thing more than foreign movies . . littered with stories about movies . . for me , Malaysians rarely do factual stories . . want to ask to read history , kaji . jauh . . read a novel"
"Malaysian animated movie like upin ipin , boboiboy & agent ali far better then matt kilau even though it's target audience"
"Watched it with an open mind , but Mat"
"Why do many people say Mat Kilau's story is bad/give a bad rating? That's why before this , why can the movie explode?"
"Well for me . . from the point of view of the movement of the camera in Mat Kilau , it is less like a Hollywood action movie . . . but I appreciate the script in that movie more . . how are the characteristics of the Malays that cause the invasion of colonists , consumed by incitement and influence"
I cried 2 times while watching the movie
"Can't compare with anything . The movie itself is cringe , more action but shakes here and there , the sound doesn't match the action shown . If the Mat Kilau is good for you , I guess that's your standard of 'a good movie'"
Fate is not a die-hard movie watcher . I want to see an Elvis movie and I haven't decided to settle for weeks . not to mention mat
gonna block everyone who complains about mat kilau i know movies are open for criticism but idc yall are just miserable people who's
"It's a pity to curse the movie Mat Kilau , but when I first went to the cinema , I didn't even see the noob review , then I didn't see it"
Matt
I've seen Mat Kilau on netflix already . Syamsul Yusuf's typical action movie . I'm so bored that I don't feel like commenting . 
"I see the best . Your mind is narrow to make a comparison with Hollywood , it's really different , people with a budget of ten million . Matt kilau is a movie about history , where can you turn it away like an action or sci-fi movie , you expect"
Even Mat Kilau movie articles want to fight
"Are you talking about Mat Kilau again? That brother has collected millions of other people who are satisfied with hate , he doesn't need to insult us who watch it . . I like watching that movie because he talks about former fighters and Islam . . this movie is not the way that brother preaches & that's why some people don't like it"
"Also , the one who made Cite Mat Kilau is Syamsul Yusof , one of the best movie authors in Malaysia . If the movie he made is a lot of complaints , let alone another author who produced the story . Anyway , it's ok , at least there is a story that shows about history"
"Well said mate! I'm not a fan of history , but because the movie Mat Kilau has an exhaustive chapter on the history of Mat Kilau , I'm looking for reading sources . He has that effect , I can feel it baby . That's for me , to get distracted by other movies"
"Mat Kilau eh? hahahhaha , here it is . . . it's just a movie . that's right bro . It's like turning everything away . just let him or her be . scroll"
"Sept 18 , 2022 - I haven't seen Mat Kilau yet , no movies & no Netflix . Anyone who has seen it , understands that it is a movie , not the History Channel . So there is a little adjustment , so chill . . just enjoy it"
The full movie is available on YouTube
I hope you can see what it's like behind the scene battle movie 1917 . Then just see how Syamsul Yusof made the Mat scene

Remember we have moved on from Mat Kilau when the movie release near the cinema . Now we're all back to square one
"The only bad thing in this movie is that , they didn't make it clear enough what race and what religion Mat"
"Louder sis . . I'm tired . When do you want to finish this Mat Kilau topic?? If it's just a review and opinion , just do it . . No need to criticize other people's taste . . Support local movies but criticize with"

It's rare to judge from the cinematography , background music , camera , etc . "

"A lot of people comment on the movie , your expectations are very high . The movie is normal but for me , I want to compare it to other Malay movies"
"Even though I'm a fan of Marvel movies and don't have much interest in Malay movies , the Mat Kilau is better than Thor's stupid joke . Again"
"Mat Kilau is the FIRST PROJECT of the entire planned franchise and his success at the box office was unexpected . The movie wasn't supposed to be as great as you expected , MK is just an introduction and also can be considered as a ""test"

"For those of you who are arguing about the Mat Kilau that got hundreds of millions , right? I want to know the amount of the lawsuit he got for the box office movie Gadis"
Why are people so stressed about Mat Kilau? It is not the greatest movie on earth but I do enjoy it
There are also a few of our society who are stupid . Comparing Mat Kilau movies with commercials about consensus
"why is there a season 2? why are there still so many people coming back after this movie? hasn't it been released for a long time? no , genuinely"
"People hype about Mat Kilau because we are thirsty for the historical film genre But if people don't like the movie , it doesn't make them anti-Malay or whatever . The movie itself sucks . It can't be helped No Mat Kilaur how we quarrel , Syamsul Yusof is still rich and we still complain about why tomorrow"
"Btw , right , you don't like the action scene in Mat Kilau because it's noisy and over like a Tamil movie? I'm your fav father . Because I like Tamil movies . Mom , I like Tamil movies Vangan Vangan . Even using a banana can kill . Because we watch movies to enjoy"
"Movie reviewer Malay in 2023 be like: ""For me , Mat Kilau is not the best , the dialogue feels unnatural and there are many scenes where the camera shakes very badly . So my rating"
"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix , best , there is a standard . But it's not as good as Zhaf's review . He hyped the movie too much . Although 3/5"
"A lot of people downgrade Mat Kilau movies after they come out on Netflix . If you want to see , see , don't make noise"
"I just want to appreciate Mat Kilau just as it is . A movie with great fighting scenes . You can see the effort from importing outside actors . The historically part is the last thing I want to comment on . As compem cincai . As a script writer , I don't want to highlight it I have a lot of speeches"
"One of the factors behind the success of Mat Kilau was that Lightyears was not aired , nor was Thor . There is no competition from other movies for legs"
Are Mat Kilau the movie and Lawrence of Arabia of the same
"Kannnnn , I don't know , lately a lot of people are criticizing that Mat Kilau movie , but it's not good during the screening . "
"Maybe for bro this movie is a popcorn movie . But maybe there are a few who take it as knowledge . Because there are people who start to discover the original story of psl heroes mat kilau and other heroes . Ok what . . ""I mean a few , you know . Not"
"I don't know why you want to defend the Mat Kilau movie so much , the quality is not equal , the standard of SY has that movie , he is good at trying new things & has a strong influence in commercial but the movie does not depict the real atmosphere of Mat Kilau"
"Yes correct . But please make the story of the prophet and make it a historical fiction movie . That's what I don't agree with . Ni Kisah mat kilau Beb: Even though it's big , it's not the same . But there is also input , right: psl silat psl religion psl war with colonialists . So we take it as good input"
can Mat Kilau do better? yes But it was
"It's true that Pramlee also makes period films using the standard language of his time , but the presentation of his time is better . but I swear this project is close to syamsul yusuf , for me he is good at popcorn movies and Mat Kilau shouldn't be popcorn movies"
for me Mat Kilau movie is exactly for the BMF
"Saying Mat Kilau a bad movie not going to make you cool . . . And I am not cool . . . Eye candy from the style frame but not in actual footage and it the movie is forcing too much . To be honest , most of the movies by Samsul have a cringy script . I felt funny rather than"
Is it really bad to watch the movie Mat Kilau? I didn't see it tonight . Because the member asked him yesterday
"yes its in bad taste to say about audience has iq . we critique mainly the storytelling like low iq meaning no complexity in characters arcs , so you can shut down ur brain and enjoy . Let's call it popcorn movie . but it's a pity that the legend is like a Mat Kilau made like that"
"Sis , because here , if we talk about other barbie movies , my personality is a little bubbly . so bear w me eh character is sis , it must be worse than the British character in mat"
"For me , right , before you want to see the history of the movie , you have to look at his character . Mat kilau is a warrior + scholar , it must be his context about Islam and the struggle . Let's talk a little about Islam"
A lot of people turned to foreigners after the release of the movie Mat Kilau
I don't know . . I don't even get money after fighting so hard . Just
"This Mat Kilau is for those who are interested in 100% action movies , they will really love it You really have to force your eyes and ears to watch this movie until it ends at the cinema"
Can you imagine that the sacrifice that they do . At the end of the movie you can see most of the villagers come to help Mat Kilau . It does really happen . Guerrilla war as it was called . Please don't mock it if you never appreciate the history . I feel sad
"According to the movie Mat Kilau , you are the one who wants to fight , curse 7 generations . It's a movie . No one is forcing you to watch , this is not Japanese Kempitei forcing you to watch Nihon propaganda . The Producers are laughing their way to the bank , the more rowdy the more people watch the movie"
"When I'm a little older , I'm not interested in watching Mat Kilau on Netflix or the cinema . I am not sure to what extent the historical facts in this story are correct . How time has changed . I used to love this kind of"
"I don't know , even for me the Mat Kilau is normal , but I give more credit after watching Zhaf's talk with Syamsul Yusof . When I saw syamsul explain , I understood that the movie should be able to go further , but there were many factors that prevented it , but syamsul still did his best . That's right"
"I've seen the Mat Kilau . Not the best . Air firce is not the best . Fortunately , I want to look at sukhoi so it's a little better . Overrated 2 movies"
"Yeah . So I think the opinion that you see on Netflix that Mat Kilau is the best is not wrong . The vibes you see on the stage & TV/phone screen are completely different . I tried to check the KKN in Desa Penari and I fell asleep . The general public knows that Netflix full movie . It's not like in the cinema , many scenes are cut here . "
Why doesn't it come out on netflix?
i actually don't care if this Mat Kilau is good or not all i care is Malaysia is finally making a movie about historical figures fuck off with the choreography or cinematography
"What I can say is that people who watch Mat Kilau on Netflix are suddenly the greatest movie critic . Comparing with the best Hollywood movies . First , compare it with local films . It's a huge step up from the film Rempit &"
"I don't know , I do enjoy Mat Kilau on Netflix , expect a movie from SY , it's a bit like his style , my parents enjoy , I'm enjoying , the fighting so nice , the cine not bad actually , actors n acting"
I didn't see the Mat Kilau . 
But we see still far away better than your silly movie like mat
Mat Kilau is an action comic book superhero movie . It's missing a grounded character who subtly breaks the 4th wall & it'd be perfect . Was laughing
I've seen Mat Kilau glitter in the cinema and on netflix In cinemas 3 . 5/5 On netflix 4/5 This movie makes martial arts look like this
Good comment . Syamsul has to read the negative comments that build up his movie for his own good . Mat Kilau's success now is due to other factors . The quality of this kind of film does not guarantee the success of his films in the future . He got it
"Sm ppl on TW judge Mat Kilau but for me it such a good movie . Simple but enough with meaning and easy for young gene to understand . Yes maybe the CGI also script and action scene too cringe but come on how can u expect it is same level with hollywood movie , its just from local"
100 million luster mat? Idk why collect that much but actually the movie is not that good . I'm glad I don't waste mine
Why do people write Japanese movie Mat Kilau . I'm a Malaysian
"The 2nd time I saw my children . . my mother also came up to give a lecture . . anything that reminds me of God is not Roblox . . that's why Mat Kilau is the best movie for me who is trying to understand about race , religion and"
"Mat Kilau 7/10 , Abang long fadil 6/10 . My opinion , why brother long fadil is 6/10 because it's cliche . I don't know how people can rate 9/10 . The movie cycle is just the same as the mat saleh movie and some parts are not quite right"
"It may not be suitable for some people's expectations , we watch the movie for various purposes . The first time we saw Mat Kilau , the national hero , while watching the touching story of how our ancestors were killed at will . The 2nd time bring the children to get to know Mat"
"I think the biggest turn off for the movie mat kilau tu is how inconsistent and different the way everyone talks . For a second speak basic Malay , for a second a bit modern . My brain can't enjoy the traditional vibe (??) they're trying to"
"my review on mat kilau movie: can work harder on character development , background sound placement , camerawork , script . feel like everything is rushed son"
"As someone who watched Mat Kilau in cinemas TWICE!!! the dialogue and script really cringe buttttttttt the language and Malay dialect that were used is nicely done actually . It's a movie and it's only based on the true story , why"
"It's true , it really is way behind compared to braveheart or any other historical western movie . But its a step forward from our past . From rempit movies to hantu kak limah etc , now we are making much better quality movies that portray our local figures as"
What is the solution for the next movie from criticism
ash
"I think they know Mat Kilau glitter because the movie has another name , who can remember . and some of them who people consider Malay warriors are actually 'landlords' to collect taxes . so when the British came to take over tax Mat Kilaurs , people started struggling . even though 2 times"
"Unpopular opinion . Mat Kilau is a propaganda movie for UMNO , PAS and other political groups that are based on Malay centric"
Have to say Mat Kilau is
"hopefully there'd be more proper adaptations of our local heroes , but maybe the next ones will be for other filmmakers to give them justice . sad really , cuz i really love the story of mat kilau as a kid . but then to see him being used as a propa movie this way kinda breaks me"
bcs i feel like the patriotism in me is woken up by watching mat kilau bcs its been years since the last time i watched movies like that
"definitely not the worst we've seen in terms of filmmaking , but the message of the movie itself is the main problematic thing that some of us have been criticizing against . we for sure wouldn't want to see more of the agenda-pushing ideas of SY's mat kilau to be prevalent"
"Mat Kilau cinematography is on a level where it is accepted and I will attack any other movies that leave the movie 'flat' because they are lazy . In their case , the black levels were"
"okay but why's everyone saying watching mat kilau on netflix is . . . yk for me it was the best experience . well maybe because I rarely watch movies . but overall i'm okay with it other people's opinion"" right? shaky camera"" is normal , malay movies"
I've watched it for free on Netflix and then it's noisy . I'm thankful that the director is right that this movie is playing on Netflix . Do you know how big the budget is for this movie? Almost the same Hollywood level . Many are willing to fight for seats for the movie mat
One more thing about this movie Mat kilau is their script! The script could have sounded more classic . I don't . It's like a member talking to a sitting member
"Movie Mat Kilau , if you have vertigo , don't watch it . Keluaq wayang confirmed that the world is upside down . I can even watch part of the fight scene and feel dizzy"
All those who cursed Mat Kilau movie are those who just watched it on Netflix . . not those who watched it at the cinema . . Why eh?? Can anyone give a reasonable explanation
"I now conclude that some Malaysians don't know how to delve into history and literally make fun of everything , what's so funny about Mat Kilau? It's a good historical movie with tons of heartfelt moments and"
"If you cringe , don't worry . Alas . I can't see netflix JEEEE . If it doesn't come out on netflix , I don't know about this Mat Kilau movie . WEAK . Don't criticize let it be in the circle of people bro"
I will try giving a chance to Mat Kilau movie . tomorrow
"Movie is a form of art . And art , as we know , is subjective . So he's so eager to dictate what's best or not best on behalf of others that it's up to his throat . My opinion about Mat Kilau is only one , his camera work makes me dizzy"
"Had to say this since a lot of talking abt mat kilau , i get yall points by saying that movie needs a lot of improvement , but to say people who don't see that IQ is low or saying ""stupid people support umno"" are even more stupid connotation . Ckp other stupid people doesn't make u look brilliant"
"Thank god I'm not alone , I thought I was the only one who thought Mat Kilau was cringe ah . Actors were great , I just felt the movie was over romanticized with them"
mat kilau was good bro i don't really watch malay fighting movies and even malay movies in general and mat kilau was
"People might expect a director to release a small movie from that era , but if you make a movie like that , you'll get bored of that era and it doesn't suit the taste of today's kids . What's wrong with the director making a movie based on what Gen Z wants to see? hmm poor custom"
I don't want to review the movie Mat Kilau
"Mat Kilau is 5 stars in terms of marketing , that's why it costs 100 million . I like Beto's acting in this movie . His eyes are expensive"
"why are many people criticizing the Mat Kilau , for me the movie is ok and there is"
"For me , it's the best gilaa movie air force , I feel like your quote should be comparable to Mat Kilau , you know , because it's cheap"
"Done look at the Mat Kilau 1- honestly , personally I would rate 5/10 for this movie . Kinda overrated but overall okay . 2- idk but this is just from my opinion as a viewer you know . I know I don't have knowledge in movies but I have to agree when people say the camera time action is amazing"
"Okay , since Mat Kilau movie is suddenly viral now , I want to review a little bit about the movie . I give it 6/10 . First of all , I like how the movie is about the historical of Malaya fighting British colonies . The point is there . But ofc la , there is a lot of the meh side of the"
Why do the people who comment on the Mat Kilau movie say that they watched the movie for free like that? Netflix has to pay subs . I'm going to watch netflix
I think Mat Kilau is much better than Thor 4 I don't think it's the same as you You guys are born straight into action
Race Supramacy Mat Kilau
"Tbh , mat kilau was an ok movie . Quite decent but not that impressive . Afterall , we bought the ticket to support local film although I fell asleep at the last 30min of the"
"Mat Kilau is one of the interesting historical movies . Even though the story line has been developed differently from the original story , we have known one of the Malay fighters for a long time"
"I don't understand if it's noisy , this Mat Kilau is over rated . I'm ok with that quote . That's the level of Malay movies . It's ok because I don't see it in a typical movie . Or a funny ghost movie that is obviously stupid . I want to expect like the Korean cite Mat Kilau that is lambert again"
"You all complaining about the movie Mat Kilau are bored because they keep giving ""speech"" etc . , if your race and religion are in danger you won't want to chat over coffee , what's the Mat Kilaur? Just take what people say as a reminder and"
"I'm not good at reviewing movies in the same way that I'm not very good at reviewing food . If I say it's not the best and it's not good , it's a bad category . Today , many people have a Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau look . I'm ready to watch the movie twice hahaha . And I still don't know"
I literally cried so hard watching mat kilau near the movie and yall wanna say that movie is bad bad? Maybe what is shown at the cinema is not the same at netflix because wtf icb
"I started reading about the history of the Titanic because I just watched the movie Titanic . It's the same after people look at Mat Kilau . At that time , many people were interested in looking back at people to do research on Mat Kilau and read it"
"My favorite moment was when Mat Kilau said ""It's Kilau Time"" and kilaued/defeated the British soldiers . Definitely one of the movies of all"
You enjoyed the movie ok . You're not enjoying it then ok too . To each their own . He turned away because he was tired of reading because he hadn't finished the chapter yet
"My 8-year-old stepdaughter has an interest in Mat Kilau . He was really excited when he saw the movie Mat Kilau that day . Until now , he is still crazy about Mat Kilau . From Mat Kilau's story , he found many other histories . I'm tired"
"It's crazy how lively and beautiful this RRR movie is hahaha 3 hours , it's not lame like a dead man"
The anti-Malay thing is endless and turns to Mat kilau's movie review . Do not have
"It's like me in a scene like that Hindustan movie , that is in one of these scenes where Matt puts a dagger on the neck of Captain Syers . . whispers his name and then the music score comes out . "
"A simple review about Mat Kilau film: I just watched it on netflix last night , for the first time , it's a standard local movie , with the most important action sequence style , slow motion must be there , and I have a feeling that this scene looks like a movie scene"
"Yesterday I just saw Mat Kilau . I've been watching people update their ratings . hmmm , personally , there are many shortcomings in this movie , but the story is great for the dialogue part and"
"I watched mat kilau when it first came out with my sister . Legit could not take the movie seriously because I look at adi putra , all I see is Jai from KL gangster . I can't hold in the laughter every time my mind makes the"
Many of them are biiter with movie mat kilau rilek
"That's right , after that you can cite Najib for corruption without joining the struggle , why does everything have to be politicized? People just watch the movie , they don't want to watch trashy political stories , they want political talk , wait for the pru , they want to insult the Mat Kilau movie just to insult the political party"
"The thing is , if it had been a GOOD movie based on Malay historical figures , it would have appealed to non-Malays as well . As if we all didn't learn about Mat Kilau in school? But it was deliberately made in such a way as to alienate"
"Just wondering , will Mat Kilau , the movie , be able to influence the masses in the upcoming GE 15? Is it significant enough to create sentiments among them"
Condemn Mat Kilau like
The one who commented (after watching it on Netflix) seemed to go to see Mat Kilau in the movie theater is a low IQ audience . . Turned to Malay . . It's about the movie that they are willing to insult other people . . This movie has a lot of holes but it's relaxing
"That day the members went to see Mat Kilau at the cinema . So yesterday I sent him a photo of Adam watching the movie . He replied , oh I know this movie . It's Mat something right? I'm tired friends with this dipping mat . He didn't register to vote after I went to Vietnam"
I don't know if I'm not interested in history or if it's the Mat Kilau movie
"i have seen a lot of negative comments towrds Mat Kilau and honestly everyone can have their own opinion right? so imo , there's no harm in liking that movie eventho its fictional but we all know the fact that Mat Kilau is"
People who like low-budget movies would probably like Mat Kilau and believe it's the greatest thing that's ever happened since their standards are so low . Mat Kilau is simply
M
"These few days , many people are less interested in Mat Kilau shown on netflix & comment about the movie . "
There is very little history in Mat Kilau . So don't expect too much . There are many facts that are wrong with the movie . I want to watch when I'm bored
People complain about the Mat Kilau camera shaking is suitable for Malays . . . . I mean you guys are right . But the story aduhhh this is my second movie where I ended up standing up swearing in front of the TV after Bukit
He's the guy playing
"1 . Cringe script 2 . Special Moves mini reunion 3 . Naively narrated 4 . Although the name of the movie is Mat Kilau , from the movie alone , how much did we get to know Mat Kilau? Imo , Beto*s character was more dominant 5 . The sound effect of the fighting scene is extreme , losing the guitar"
"mention this Mat Kilau . . . . he's a great actor I know who's playing but when you watch this movie , from the beginning haha~ line up"
"Hahah , I said this Mat Kilau was inspired by the movie wong feihung because the sound effect is like Chinese martial art"
"Matt movie is not the best , save money , I don't watch the movie with the action scene , the camera man is shaking , the shooting is martial arts too"
"Not going to even bother watching Mat Kilau . The decline of the Malaysian movie industry is as clear as day . We have stopped learning , stopped innovating , stopped trying . We have the best neighbors (eg . Indo , Thailand) to learn from , but no , we reward"
The raid is an Indonesian film . . the director of captain america only admitted that his fighting scene was inspired by the raid . . even samuel l jackson said that the raid was his all time favorite movie . . this is a Mat Kilau finish you set with the raid
"Special Moves series PASCAL Police Evo Mat Kilau Everyone has their own class Maybe we don't know how many children of Watan whose exposure to police/soldiers/heroes came from this movie For me , this is more important than debating the cinematography issue"
You look at the movie and it doesn't Mat Kilau
Forget about other people's art . . the way I give my opinion can be accepted with the highest Mat Kilau film sales in Malaysia so far
"Can y'all please STFU about reviewing Mat Kilau? If you like it , great . If you don't , it's alright . Everyone has their own taste when watching movies or TV shows . But if y'all make shit up just to fight over a MOVIE , go fuck yourself and touch some grass"
"Actually , I want to rate the Mat Kilau low because I can yawn throughout the story . It rarely happens . But because people buy movie tickets , so I end up rate is high , saying it's good but not the best"
"I don't know why watching a movie can tell people's IQ . If you think Mat Kilau is not the best , just say it's not the best , it's not your taste . But if you want to judge the IQ of the person who watched it based on 1 movie , he said it was the best"
I love all these reviews about Mat Kilau on FB that movie is just
"Mat Kilau is really bad but ITS devil worshipers are different bro , so sorry we have better"
"Sorry i can't give my review for Mat Kilau yet , because the one that is on Netflix rn is just a 2-hour long epic movie trailer . . I believe the actual movie will be released"
"Look , this movie is supposed to unite the Malays , this is dividing the Malays even more"
A lot of people have arrived
Mat kilau is a normal movie for me . But it's not too bad . The earnings of this film can reach 90 million . But you don't need to be the smartest to criticize . You record a selfie video of yourself pom shaking . I want to criticize
Finally being able to watch Mat Kilau after Netflix broadcast it starting yesterday . In my honest opinion even though got a lot of things to improve it's still a great
"Mat kilau is a movie to watch once , not repeat many times . But this movie is not very bad like the netizens criticize . No need to comment badly to criticize people who don't care about your tweet . You don't know the pom who hates that"
"I hope to be able to see Mat Kilau's character live , what kind of personality he has . his conversational style . what I understand is only philosophy . The script of the movie and the character of Mat Kilau is not"
"When Mat Kilau comes out on neflix , movie critics come out and comment like this , Air Force hasn't yet had a story on neflix , ghisau is turned away by the soldiers who comment later . Guys , to produce a movie requires mental and physical sacrifice from each member"
"Why is Mat Kilau's time in movies mostly rated 8/10 , 9/10 , 100/10 . . But when it's on Netflix , people rate 2/10 , -3/10?? Ready to finish one movie in 3 days . Just plan to see it tomorrow"
Kakakakaka mende lah bekap movie mat
The name of the movie is not diary mat kilau and friends . Don't show that stupidity on social media . Shy
"That means neutral , you're not Malay , and you don't know Mat Kilau . Character development in the story is very low . There is indeed a messy plot , for example Awang , the motive behind the creation of the role of Awang is not clear . Wanted to turn it into a drama in a movie , but it didn't happen . From the beginning to"
"It's ok , I'll look at this Mat Kilau story . What are you so fussy about? But for me it's not a big impact to have a movie"
That's why many uncertified movie reviewers were born after the luster
"I will indeed compare it to Merong Mahawangsa because that movie is the best despite having a movie years ago . the ending is also satisfied , not messy . There is no conclusion to this Mat Kilau . It looks very rushed , like you MUST make a movie below 2"
What's the fuss about the Mat Kilau movie btw? Everything is bad . N the lack of extras in each scene just shows that the movie is bad . Really
"If I'm not mistaken , when Mat Kilau came out of the cinema , everyone like , 'it's good' , 'great movies' and whatever . And then Netflix came out , everyone gave bad reviews? What"
Mat Kilau is one of those movies that you love watching the first time and would absolutely hate watching it the second time
"Have you ever seen the IP story? How is he against 10 people? But those who attack him are not all at once . Just like this Mat Kilau story . It's called a story . If you want to be logical , you just read history . No need to look"
"Just looked at the Mat Kilau . It's like watching Isley's Malay speech . The battle scene is dizzying , the camera moves faster than silat . This is the best taste of the movie"
tl today all discuss issues
Is Mat Kilau really that bad of a movie? (Seriously
I only watched the first 5 minutes of mat kilau to already know what's the rest of the movie gonna be like . And it's not what I expected at all based on the sales it made when it arrived
"If you want to give your opinion , you don't want to quote Malay , you can put a polite comment , comment with manners , it's ready to mention a movie for people with a low IQ , how can you lose your manners just by watching the movie Mat Kilau? Watch out today , everyone is trying hard to be the Zhafvlog"
"Mf be like Mat Kilau is a 3/10 and compare it to IP Man when the Malaysian movie track record is Evolusi KL Drift , Impak Maksima and Bini-Biniku"
"What's the case with people raging about Mat Kilau? Relax . Like is subjective . Some like it some don't . It's okay to back up too much or curse too much . To me , can be 1 of my favorite patriotic movies besides Bukit Kepong & Lieutenant"
"None , we watch Mat Kilau and other action/horror"
"comment a little bit about the Mat Kilau film movie . there is something more like him tering everything , turning away"
"Since Mat Kilau has been on netflix , many people have made reviews . . it's like I collected tens of millions , but reviews like this movie are almost too much . . I'm waiting for Air Force to come on netflix , I want to read a review , is there anyone who agrees with it?"
I think people are expressing their disappointment on mat kilau because we rarely get a biopic movie about national heroes . Last time was lieutenant Adnan? Decades later it just got a Mat Kilau (correct me if im wrong) so they expect something wow in
"Done watching the most viral and hype movie ever this year , Mat Kilau . Although it was super cringe but not bad for an Asian producer . I would rate"
there's no end to the Mat Kilaur of Mat Kilau . Those people are already rich . wait . watch the movie . haha . What are you talking about on Twitter?
1 month ago we have supporters who went absolute total blind die hard support on Mat Kilau as if that was the best Malaysian movie ever . Now we have detractors who criticize the movie frame by frame like it's total
"Mat Kilau is a movie . But netizens who are so sarcastic can't be criticized . There are critics like it should depict 101% of history , which doesn't make sense because the movie is made to appeal to the most segment"
"Uwow just realized there's a lot of prejudices on Mat Kilau movie . From the historical aspects of the movie , I think there is not much to be learned as this is not a biography . But to say the movie is for ""Malays with low IQ"" is too"
"Where are you? I don't like all movies . But before this Mat Kilau movie started , someone wrote to tell me that this movie is just fiction . Not round and round follow . Some have also been changed . That's what he meant . You're not focused , you want to talk to me . That's a lot to see"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau . It's an enjoyable movie . Despite its flaws , weakness and overuse of fast action shots . "
"Already watched Mat Kilau . How to say? I can only give around 1 out of 5 stars . There are so many weaknesses . If you don't want to get ready to relax , fill in the space or give it to the kids , that's it . But not recommended at all for action movies/dramas & history lovers . I like action genre and history"
"Malay klu in the chat section condemned person no . 1 . Hg tgk movie not documentary . He has already made a disclaimer . He has a movie he likes . It's not based on the true story of the last two blackhawkdowns , the west didn't win apo . Suh barat has a hero to make a new Mat Kilau comparable to your taste"
"what you should be angry about is how shitty the movie was made based on the legendary mat kilau . flawed dialogue , cinematography kl"
Defo not . i don't watch movies much and Mat Kilau is really fine
"For me , the luster is normal and I don't have a problem with you being the best because other people have different tastes . But I don't understand that the movie has been in theaters for a long time , ready to collect 100 , 000 , and now people want to criticize it . When it's airing , there's no fuss like this"
not surprised to see mat kilau getting low ratings from people . i've said it before that the pacing was so off and the dialogue sounds pretentious in every way . you can make a patriotic/historical movie without it being as messy as it is
"Thank you for your review . But you know how the effort to make the old historical to become a movie? That is not easy to satisfy everyone , but for me Mat Kilau is the best Malay movie that we can watch to remember the services of our heroes"
"Akhi , we want to be alerted , follow Al-Kuliyyah TV3 . It's more appropriate in a knowledge ceremony like that from the movie Mat Kilau This is my advice for you , brother . Don't have a few verses of the Quran in the movie , I was shocked . That's called lack of soul filling"
"Actually , if you want to criticize Mat Kilau or like Mat Kilau , it's okay . What movie is wrong?"
"What am I talking about? Do you watch movies like this , do you have an artistic soul? Since when can a movie with an artistic soul make money? If there aren't many rich art people It's either They make it fun or They ride the sentiment . Mat Kilau is the"
"I always tell people who haven't seen Mat Kilau , if you want to see the film version of Perhimpunan Agong UMNO . . . Watch the film . It's a bad movie . The positive from the movie , Beto"
"true! many discussions in terms of expanding knowledge in history this what historical movies should be , endless discussion . Independence does not happen without discussions . mat kilau is more like promoting culture w history but history is more"
"Just watched MAT KILAU in netflix . It was a nice movie to watch and get to learn who you are , where are you coming from , where should you stand and why Mat Kilau wanted to save the land so badly , there is a lyrics stated in Negaraku . 4 . 5 cause the ending . . finished"
"Okay , it's everyone's opinion about the Mat Kilau finish , but if"
Finally watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . Let's just say I'm very glad I watched it and wasn't swayed by the reviews from back home . Not to mention the scandal surrounding the movie that had nothing to do with
"When people bring up the issue of Mat Kilau , they just noticed why this year not many people share the independence video for Malaysia Day . There is only one . I always see two or three shorts"
I rather watch Ratsasan (Tamil movie) for the 6th time than watch Mat Kilau for the 2nd
First 10 mins of Mat Kilau is making me how'd
"Since yesterday Mat Kilau started showing on Netflix , it seems that there are more and more negative reviews lol . yes that movie is such a meh . People were not exaggerating tho about the shaky camera . Character development almost none , and the story ends with the climax , no"
"After months of people talking about the movie Mat Kilau ritu , today I can only watch it after going to Netflix . I rarely go to the movies later for sure"
"I'm the only one who doesn't watch the Mat Kilau drama/movie at the cinema . And even when it's free on Netflix , it still doesn't work"
Matt
"Those who don't like watching Mat Kilau movies are welcome . . It's up to each other . . . But I'm ready to stamp people who like to watch that story as ""low IQ"" that's more than enough . . . . . Lek2 dahlewâ€¦"
Mat Kilau is a
Is the Mat Kilau movie good? It's a movie . Has a specific appeal . Triggers some specific feelings . Doesn't really leave a lasting impression . Not the actors nor crew's fault . The producer and director just have a specific mission . Was never meant to be
"I also think mat kilau should make a telemovie or movie close to ASTRO first , seriously overrated . For me brother syamsul should've done a lot better than"
"I admit that mat kilau only has 6-7 over 10 storylines . But the acting and effort to produce such a movie is a power , it can cover up the weaknesses of this story . A lot of people just watch it on netflix for"
"Mat Kilau , good movie if you're watching it for the"
tiber so many dislikes
tiber so many dislike for Mat Kilau
"Personally , I really don't like the movie directed by Yusoff's son because I've seen it once on TV , Munafik . Hahahaha so when this Mat Kilau comes out , I'm skeptical when people say it's crazy . The timeline is full of words , it's not the best when it's on Netflix . Fortunately , I didn't run out of money"
"Don't compare it with foreign movies , local movies too , sergeant hassan , even paskal . There is the same element of patriotic spirit without the cringe dialogue & messy plot . But Mat Kilau is still crazy , just because it's Malaysian . Try to turn off the hype & watch it with a neutral feeling . Still"
"People see Mat Kilau near the cinema because of the hype from people who say it's the best . . . I went to the movies with my sister , I also watched . Wtf , not even worth the hype . Just an average movie with horrible fighting scenes"
"Sooo Mat Kilau is it that bad? I read that some people turn off the TV , change to another movie after 10 , 20"
Who is the famous movie critic in Malaysia who dares to promote that Mat Kilau? Now I really doubt his credibility . What the hell do you think this is a crazy solid story? You have no taste
I just feel like watching a movie
After watching it on netflix . . for me this movie is overrated . . air force movie again
"Thanks Netflix for showing the movie Mat Kilau . . with all the hype goin on , our family excited with this movie when it released . . we watched yesterday the whole family , and after 30 minutes of the movie , my mom literally zzzz . . . . it shows whatâ€¦â€¦ (fill in the"
the sentence . . . will you see elvis next week? until I can't see it like this . . . wait for the movie to appear on hotstar or netflix last2 mat kilau appear on netflix
Translating
Last night I watched Mat Kilau on Netflix hmmm I still don't understand why people talk about that movie
You don't like the idea of a comedian taking her veil off to make a joke? Don't watch the video . You dont like an ethnonationalist Shamsul Yusof movie? Don't watch Mat Kilau . Spare yourself the unnecessary stress that you're putting your body
Also why do I think Fattah Amin's acting in Mat Kilau is better than everyone else especially Mat Kilau himself . One expression is the whole
"Instead of making a Mat Kilau , it's better to make a movie for other characters , such as tok elephant to tok beard to dato maharajalela to . . directors in Malaysia don't be lazy"
"I don't like people on Twitter who ""after 10 minutes open the Mat Kilau near netflix , it closes immediately"" I don't know what is your intention to say that . Then add on , ""it's suitable for Malays"" Haah , you're really distracted watching all the movies . The story is old , people are hyped"
Day 509 since the making of FOTD: Currently watching Mat Kilau (again) over on netflix . . and yeah it's no wonder peeps don't vibe with it . It's a mess . It'd be a good movie if it actually resonated with the people but as you see . . . there are some that
Malay but
"People say that Mat Kilau stories are adaptations , if you want facts , you should read history books . but now his issue is not just historical fact , but plot , character development , cinematography . one more thing , not because there is high expectation , but this movie is just like this"
"Finally got to watch Mat Kilau via netflix . Well , I must say good movie for a Malay historical genre n of coz the star studded cast . Didn't know tis Mat Kilau is"
"After watching the scene against Mat Kilau , I conclude that only deep people can accept the story from this alarming POV . I just want to relax and watch more movies"
"RM55 per month for example . Divide by how many movies and dramas there are . Plus , don't you want to face Mat Kilau every day? It's true that the souls of Malay warriors will die later . "
who doesn't like to watch movies mat kilau must jump the school fence during subject time
"Tolak tepi mat kilau best ka not best . . . but all this mat kilau tweets making mat kilau trending again on twitter timeline . The marketing team is shocked . You're the best , you're not the best , finally the name of the Mat Kilau movie is viral and trending as well . Mat Kilau 1 - Netizens"
Up back Mat Kilau's tweet since Netflix came out . You can enter the history of this movie . The success
I think my comment is good . That's also insulting Have faith in
"This film is Mat Kilau , I think I'm so busy swearing at the British that I don't notice what people are criticizing . But his camera"
Agreed . There are woke Malays who just hate anything about the Malays . And nowadays it's woke to insult the Malay movies esp . mega box office movie Mat Kilau . Perhaps
What's the point of arguing about Mat Kilau for months without end . You're not the one who turned into a stunt instead of fattah amin fighting in that movie
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film . From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot . What do you get? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive , I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing . That's why he brought in the premiere"
"You are fighting about Mat Kilau film . From the historical plot to the fictional movie plot . What do you get? If you think criticism is constructive and destructive , I would say your fight is just a plus point for marketing . That's why during the premiere he was transported into the movie"
It's bad that the luster got stuck hahaha luckily I never felt like watching it from the start . A movie that only caters the Malays indeed if you watch this movie for sure I'd leave my ass after 10 mins into the
Showing Mat Kilau on Netflix has become the movie to show to a large number of people/relatives who came to your home so you don't have to interact with
"Just need to add on how it is . The note that was given to the villagers for taxation , ends with ""God save the queen"" . During 1892 ""mat kilau movie setting"" the ruler of England was King George V . Small details Mat Kilaur's"
I don't know why people don't like Mat Kilau? The movie is so good and the fact the movie is based on truth
"Many cytros give bad reviews about Mat Kilau , or Mat Kilau movies that don't meet other people's tastes and expectations to me , mat kilau is a very good movie want to say five stars , no , four stars already"
"This mat kilau story focuses on the character development of the mat kilau friends the camera does not shake , who said shake , is a liar , the camera has a lot of close ups to martial arts techniques , and the action is fast but can still be captured and understood no problem with audio"
I watched mat kilau yesterday on netflix . As expected . Hence I rarely watch Malay movies
Actually Syamsul already admitted some mistakes in the movie Mat Kilau in his press conference . And he didn't expect the net worth will
"Yesterday I watched the movie Mat Kilau with my family . I'm just my wife , I skip making coffee , playing games aha . Bored! It's good that I wasn't fooled by the movie ""review"" from twidder . Remember the last Malay movie I saw at the cinema , Mimpi Dilaila . . ughh how stupid was that"
"movie mat kilau time stamped 1:48:51 , when kilau got a sword , what did he do to rest , because Wahid was the opponent"
what does liking Mat Kilau have to do with getting it back? Even the movie is relaxing . A lot of people hesitate when watching LGBT movies because they are afraid of reality . but Mat Kilau film itself also wants to relate to reality . its just a fvcking movie . 
remind cite biography . even though there is absolutely no mention of the main character . well put the title of the movie 'Ini Tanah Kami' . not 'Mat Kilau' . Awang's character stands out from the characters
"Mat Kilau cinematography and its continuity could be a lot , A LOT better . The script and wording doesn't really scream quality movie . Limited character development . I mean . . I enjoyed Ejen Ali the Movie much more than"
"Naturally , it's a blockbuster movie . Imagine a Mat Kilau film only 100k people watched . Maybe 1-10% don't like it , haters . We think many people like this movie because only 1-10k say it's boring/trash . But if 6 million people watch it . This movie has already 600k words"
"First of all , I think your IQ is very high , syamsul use one ""character"" to raise the religion of Islam and don't forget Mat Kilau is a person who is fluent in tassawur , that's why syamsul included the element of ""SPEECH"" in this movie . This movie is in Malay , it can be wrong"
The ones who comment & review like turning away from the taste of movie directors with the hope that Mat Kilau is in line with the films that can enter the Oscars . . . phuuiii That's how the man who supposedly has everything in his head is the greatest on social media . I don't know if I saw the teaser
Even the movie article wants to fight . It's sad to see Malays like this . Why didn't the British say Malays should unite . Even the movie article
"Haha . . many comments -ve been watching mat kilau @ netflix . I like it btw . I rarely watch Malay movies , to be exact . Syamsul knows his crowd . He knows how to tackle them . That's why his movie is rare x millionÂ² . Ppl will have diff"
"Had to watch Air Force the movie and the visuals were so bad! Still dizzy . . the story for me is best based on Malaysia has a film industry , the same goes to Mat Kilau . . well no Mat Kilaur what we can't compare our local films with films from other countries . Malaysia is fine"
Not finished with this Mat Kilau article? Change the topic . I still can't understand why the movie Thor - Love and Thunder can't go to the cinema
I would also like to evaluate the Mat Kilau movie . But later . Come on
"there are hundreds who disagree with you . If you don't like it , fine . Is it necessary to put others' preference down? People harp on Parasite & make comparison Parasite vs Mat Kilau . Heck . I fast forwarded the movie to the ending cos it bored me . Did I make fun of the Academy?"
"hahahha but it's really Mat Kilau and not the best , if you want to mess around in the middle of a movie"
"All people have different genes , so movie preferences may vary . IMO , the film Mat Kilau is not at the level of a trash film so Zhaf does not swear . Most of the films criticized by Zhaf seem to the eyes of ordinary viewers to say that the film is level"
"Can withstand the bad review of Mat Kilau . I didn't see it . Shuk saw yesterday . But I came out of the room and asked him what movie he was watching because I heard howling screams and felt nervous . I was like ""What movie is that? It sounds like chaos . I have to scream even if I want to talk"
"Tonight I want to have a movie night with Fitrie to watch the Mat Kilau . just look at the doc dang , "
So if you look at Mat Kilau near netflix
"From the beginning when I watched Mat Kilau , I said that the story was not the best . There are so many over scenes that it becomes clingy . The best Malay movie is Knife"
Perhaps prev good and critical movies are not associated with him because he does not promote the film too much like how he promotes Mat
"What he is not satisfied with is actually when actual good and critical movies don't get a response and he attributes it to the reason for the good rating at Mat Kilau . this is just a Mat Kilaur of opinion , open for debate and"
This Inspector Lim is from the time of the movie lieutenant adnan until the movie matt kilau he side
"The queen died between Aug . 31 and Sept . 16 , two very important dates for Malaysian nationalism , in a country still debating its independence narrative and colonial history . Just recently , an anti-British colonial era movie 'Mat Kilau' made over 100m ringgit in the"
"It's okay , I looked at the Mat Kilau , the empty one turned away from history . . the movie critics turned away , what's the Mat Kilaur . Just enjoy it . Woke indeterminate"
"Citer Mat Kilau is really bad . Script , plot , acting , all levels of the theater club at uni . I don't immediately feel sad or angry when I see a scene . Even the martial arts fight scene looks like Wing Chun . Anyone who thinks this movie is the best should not give an opinion about any movie"
"MAT KILAU im not condemning but my view of that movie , 2 . 5/5 stars . . so many elements are wrong . I don't see it myself . . the author is more netizens"
"I think Mat Kilau is just a normal movie . Turn off the cameraman , he has severe Parkinson's"
"You don't care , the movie is understandable and respected . Heck , I've even criticized the Mat Kilau movie . But with endless sentences ""it's suitable for Malays"" why? Are you not Malay? Are you saying you're not like most Malays?"
"I love to cry when I watch a movie , 5 minutes"
Mat Kilau has many shortcomings in his storyline . His dialogue and acting are also amazing . But right timing when many are thirsty for this kind of movie - the strongest impact is on the kids - to inculcate the feeling of
"They are using Mat Kilau's name for the movie , he's the main character , so I think the least they could do is add in a little bit of history to show that he's ""Mat Kilau"" . I'm not talking about 100% history , but at least I think there should be a distinctive scene based on"
"not blaming yall for saying Mat Kilau movie is bad , but why tf some of yall gotta make fun of SyamsulYusof and hate him for no reason?? mad respect cuz he put a lot of effort in the movie and he didnt even hurt yall , chill tf out yall need to"
"Mat Kilau said the sound of poetry Disney stories sing and sing To me , the movie is ordinary , more like propaganda . But mat saleh's story is also a lot of propaganda . So that's normal . What's not normal is that the camera works like a fly , flying"
"Movie Mat Mat Kilau is easy to understand and digest . Direct to the point . . I think the presentation is important . . if you want to understand this history you have to be relaxed . if you are serious , people will run away and not want to see"
"Grant , I think that if you want to promote it as one of the movies that promote martial arts and the Malay psyche , then that would be appropriate . Even Bunohan is more appropriate than Mat Kilau for me even though it's not really an action movie , but more like it"
"Syamsul Yusof doesn't even want to make a good movie . But he wants to make a movie that exploits this theme . Gangsterism (KL Gangster) , Witchcraft & Dark Arts (Hypocrisy) , Malay history (Mat"
"Done watching mat glitter on netflix . Why netflix because there is a small child , it is not suitable to take to the cinema . Mat Kilau review: Everything is ok , the story line (must be based on a true story right) , the color of the movie is ok . But , there are some"
"Okay , I've seen Mat Kilau on Netflix . Basically it's a movie for boys . The simple one"
Mat Kilau movie
"Our people are indeed toxic (liver problems) . Give a comment Mat Kilau , it's the first time to do it . It's not like this is his 100th historical movie . Each comment is like an expert in movies . For constructive comments . Relax-relax"
Mat Kilau is good actually . Mat salleh has a lot more movies except the one
"How many months has it been since the movie came out last month , now it's on neflix . "
"What people (initially) think are the reasons Mat Kilau is no 1: awesome cinematography , soundtrack , great cgi and fight choreography . Why its really no 1 in Malaysia: Malaysians crave movies depicting local figures as inspiring"
Interesting to read the comments of the audience version of the Mat Kilau movie
"Honestly , I enjoyed watching Mat Kilau in theater with my family . But . . . yes , the sound , camera and script thing mmng . His sound effect is so loud and over the top that even my 3-year-old nephew doesn't even notice . He was angry until the movie was over , he didn't bother people"
"Mat kilau is a bad film/movie Which colonizer wants to tell what is the weakness of the country/nation he colonized? Besides in Mat Kilau . Never ending from the beginning ""kaymu maylayu berpeciah baylah . "" Cringed"
"Conclusion , Mat Kilau is a bad but good fictional popcorn movie . Had to stop this movie as a historical movie coz too many unclear facts , clearly . Lastly , it's glitter"
"I've seen the Mat Kilau movie that day . But because of many comments after entering Netflix before , I want to enter the scene too . Yes! It's not the best! As a comparison , I can say that Air Force The Movie is better even though some people say that the action is lacking . But at least it's not hyped"
"As long as I didn't see this Mat Kilau , I tried to keep an open mind but I can't help comparing this movie to certain historical movies from Indonesia such as Kartini , Bumi Manusa etc . Indonesians have other standards"
"For movies , everyone has different taste when it comes to a movie . Some say that Mat Kilau is the best , some say it's almost , some say it's not the best . If you don't like it , why are you still watching? And yeah , one more thing , cursing and yelling doesn't even give us power , it looks like we're stupid"
"I don't even think I want to look at it . I know enough about his history , even in that movie he worked out a little bit to become that tall . Do you want to be distracted by the movie , the critic can't be criticized , it's you who are distracted , that syamsul is eating a delicious steak"
"i guess that was just personal opinion bcs i assumed by watching clips/films back then , i thought people in the past didn't talk like THAT ahahahah , to me it was just cringy as i was hoping Mat Kilau to be an extraordinary movie for"
The one who condemns that luster
"It's wrong to say that our film doesn't get support , while you yourself say that our film (Mat Kilau kilau) is for millions . Of course , the majority of our people support our movie"
"yes , I know that some will be like 'mat kilau , okay what , at least it's different from other movies , which are fun stories about love or gangsters etc' yes , that is undeniable but all this critic & review means that there is more room for films Malaysia to"
"I just finished Mat Kilau today , the movie is fine , it can be 5/10 , it's bland for me , but I understand the message of fighting spirit to convey"
For me Mat Kilau not
"what's the problem with this Mat Kilau story? Malaysians are condemned to work . You also condemn the air force story . you just make the movie . I don't like it , it's okay , I don't care . sit still"
It's good Mat Kilau borak Space . Convinced me not to watch the
"Returning from Amimek's house , I went to the night market in the mountain with heavy rain , waiting for the satay to cook , then continue that night to see the glittering Mat Kilau of the neighboring houses . It's good to continue 1 more movie . All kinds of pain"
"; There are so many people condemning the Mat Kilau movie that they just watched on Netflix that they feel like they have a low IQ level . Lol , you're confused , you have a high iq , you can go on the road with your opinion . Aachah2 turned away"
"I want to argue about Mat Kilau . this movie is subjective . if you don't like it , tweet once and then shut up"
The Mat Kilau is movie average and not very wow . But at least we know that Malay warriors are great . I agree with the shaky camera
The title of the movie Mat Kilau but we learned nothing about Mat Kilau except he's
"I admit there are flaws . But there are still many good things . So , to those who have reviewed the Mat Kilau . Continue to support other Malay movies and give more reviews . Don't stop at the Mat Kilau because"
"Who here is willing to pay rm25 to watch Malay movies?? Haha , I'm ready to watch kimchi for you at the cinema , you know . . . how much I enjoy Malay movies . From this Mat Kilau movie I see the improvement of Malay movies"
"Malaysia day , Mat Kilau movie on netflix . Once again , there are many people who review Mat Kilau . It's worse for people . Be ready to say ""maybe I have high expectations"" . Bro , people have already reviewed the movie many times , you can expect it . I'm not bitter like he says"
Mat Kilau movie really good . . I suggest
Open netflix right now to see what the hype is all about . Just 15 minutes of the movie and then watch Shippuden . 
"This is like a very good time to watch mat kilau coz the queen just die and the movie shows how bad the colonizer british treat our country/people , , how they tried to profit of our natural"
"Tgk Mat Kilau reminds me of RRR . . . the format is the same . . . intensity , background music , action are all the best , only the shaking camera part is a bit lacking . . . But still a"
"Mat Kilau is on netflix , it's over , people"
"Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . A very decent movie I must say . 3 . 5/5 His martial arts part is the best!!! The dialogue is solid , piercing the heart!!! Cinematography could do better"
What is this mat kilau movie . . . 10 mins in and i gave up . Look if I wanted to listen to a ceramah I can easily look for any misogynist Ustaz ceramah on youtube
I'll look at that Mat Kilau later . I feel like I want to watch an English movie but I don't know how
"Bro , he has already collected millions from this Mat Kilau movie . people don't even care"
Why do those who watch Mat Kilau on Netflix turn away and curse this Msia movie? This must be a species interested in Marvel movies
Haha that Mat Kilau appeals to the masses . Popular but doesn't mean to movie
It's like a Mat Kilau movie
Now why do you have to rely on Zhaf to have a movie comment eh? I don't know when he trashed all the movies on your thumbnail for clickbait . Not creative . And Mat Kilau is directed by Syamsul Yusuf . It can be said that this story is just a popcorn movie . Not a top-tier kinda
"Not a fan of Mat Kilau but at least I have something to watch on netflix with my parents . Instead of English movie with 'awkward scene' or never ending Malay ghost story , rempit movie , "
Am i the only one who wasn't really impressed with
"Many people say that this film is the best , ready to watch it 2-3 times . when you enter netflix , many people say no"
"But sis , that's the struggle of our fighters from the age of luck until the end . Their main struggle is to fight for the dignity of religion , nation and homeland . For me the script was realistic , maybe it could be completely interesting with the movie editing technique"
"I think , people use the Mat Kilau title just to attract the audience . Because the glittery character doesn't really stand out in this movie . This movie should be titled ""destroying the British in Ulu . """
"After watching the Mat Kilau movie . The camera is not relaxing . Left right front back . Part opponent to jetty to tgh bersilat to . X relax eh . Time to chat with a lot of people , change the shot every 2 seconds . Eye pain , loss of focus . Suddenly the drone shot , went back in for a close shot"
"It's already on Netflix , I still don't want to watch Mat Kilau . During the first week of the movie , I chose to watch the Elvis movie . It's not because I'm not patriotic , but I want to see the best movie"
"It's true that each has an interest , but if the Mat Kilau , the praise is soaring , but when it comes to the Air Force , he says cringe , it's a bit suss . This is my opinion as a casual moviegoer"
"thank you Netflix for bringing Mat Kilau to my home TV . proven I did not waste my money/time to go to the cinema , I slept through the movie (thankfully in the comfort of my bed) , not my cup of"
Shoojit Sircar's big laugh
I know agree to disagree . Why are people so angry when they comment on the Mat Kilau movie? Chill already . Everyone has an opinion
"instead of watching Mat Kilau , you should watch Paloh , a good pseudo historical movie by adman salleh . although the editing was quite poor I don't mind as long as the actors were paid well"
"Ni citer Mat Kilau or the documentary History of the school syllabus , "
"Maybe the problem is there , lack of public promotion . We have never heard of both movies , while Mat Kilau all out promote the movie . No wonder people claim the movie this time"
For me movie Mat Kilau x best But . . . if people like it . . . it's ok It's okay if people don't like me Preference for foreign tickets . . . byr Don't disagree . . . 
"BRO MAT KILAU WAS SO HYPED BRO , "
"Same concept as Marvel . Does the physics theory in Marvel make everyone 100% explore physics? But people talk about it . Same as this I never saw people discussing about mat kilau on social media beside textbook history . After this movie , people talk about Mat Kilau and Mat Kilau"
"Haven't seen an action movie in a while , watch it"
"Watching Mat Kilau rn . Half way through watching , I still don't understand what people are hype about"
We watched Mat Kilau tonight on Netflix . The first comment from mom after 15 minutes of the movie starting . Is that your husband? Amboi
I suspect that director Mat Kilau has never read the Brandstory book . Not following the movie principle
"Matt is not the best , it can be improved a lot if you want to make a historical movie . Luckily with netflix you can stop and continue , if you have a movie you may be asleep . One two jaga and dukun are the best , i"
"His concept is the same as Marvel & Multiverse . Multiverse is theory and Marvel only has fiction . But he has encouraged his fans to explore more physics and multiverse theory . Same as Mat Kilau . The luster of historical figures . This movie is fiction , but the Mat Kilau ofc will encourage people to explore"
"My sister is so excited to watch Mat Kilau . Hence , I let him watch the movie"
"What's the Mat Kilaur with Mat Kilau's sudden return haha? I'm talking about taste , review it , you want to drag a reviewer who likes the movie , what is it?"
literally watched mat kilau for the first 15 mins and it felt so much like watching a movie for
"I mistakenly watched a video about Mat Kilau film . I can't watch the scene where there are machetes , shooting shooting . . . stabbing everyone . Throbbing . "
"Lek zhaf , he remembers his point of view , people want to hear it , I don't hype this film , but I don't object to the point of view of people who like it , it's like if you eat nasi lemak with melted cheese , then you say that people who don't eat it are bullshit , haha"
T
I still like the language in the movie Merong Mahawangsa compared
"Sis kept looking at twitter , searching about Mat Kilau after watching not even half of the movie . It's just a minimum bear , it's just that Malaysia hasn't come out with a concept story like this for a long time , hence , people are a bit overhyped (a lot actually) . Ok that's the end of the story sis comment back even nobody"
A lot of people look at Netlfix to comment on the Mat Kilau movie . The 89 million look at it all ok . 
What a movie review
He praises it
"agree . . this movie is good , this rise is 10x from the Mat Kilau . . it makes all the hairs Mat Kilau"
"It's ok , the Mat Kilau story , I don't want it to be so bad , I'm ready to make a thread like this . Malay people really like to put down Malay people , there are many Korean stories that are overhyped and there is no plaque that the Malays want to comment until they make a thread . Lol I'm the best at watching movies"
In conjunction with Malaysia Day . I watched a movie marathon today . Mat Kilau . Sarkar . Naayak . dial
Just looked at the Mat Kilau . Just watch and enjoy . Too lazy to comment . Very many
"Haha , people on twitter condemned the movie as bad . Haha . The technical aspects of the movie are not good , but that's it , I still support the idea of the movie"
"I don't see the Mat Kilau , half of the movie I lost the opponent with the Mat Kilau , I understand it myself . Hahahaha , now I'm wondering how there are people who see it so many times at the movies?"
The gang just watched the movie Mat Kilau on Netflix and are busy trying to give a review
Fil has been feeling a bit under a weather today and asked me to record mat kilau on netflix he didnt want to miss our movie nite ok postpone
"like this try not to look at mat kilau as merely a ""movie"" that"
"Too many critics on Mat Kilau But honestly , I don't think it's a very bad movie , it can be a bonus to feel proud with enthusiasm . But air force srsly his vibes are different . 2 times aq usha and both aq nangeh . I've tried it many times but I still can't feel it"
"Precisely . . The shaking camerawork is actually to make the audience feel the situation in the movie . . And I really don't have any problem with the camerawork either in Mat Kilau and air force the movie , but still . . I understand , they need to improve of those tiny errors in their"
Mat Kilau! it's a historical movie that's really good and it's out on our netflix~ really recommend it if you have the chance to watch
Watching Mat Kilau is like watching a Tamil movie . martial arts fighting is normal but he has a sound over
"When talking about Mat Kilau , people must want to know for example: -Who is the Mat Kilau? -How is his life? -Who is his teacher? The best example of Merong Mahawangsa movie . Character building is solid . Just technology , budget , not suitable & Merong's history is much more"
"Comparing historical movies vs soap operas . Sinetron is only for tv and most of them are low budget , but this Mat Kilau with more budget and based on historical event but looks like"
Depends on the situation of the scene . Try to watch the transformers or any other action movies . . The camera shakes a lot during the action scenes . This is what they applied in Mat Kilau and air force
"a lot of people say that this Mat Kilau movie has a lot of shocks during the fight scene . . . . maam air force , the movie is still dizzy , do you know the camera movement?"
"done with no Mat Kilau . even lambertt hahah . if you see it at the movies , it's best . but that's it . My son wants to put this mano at home , he is busy going around the house when people are watching movies"
"I stand by my decision . . . Mat Kilau is a good story , I rate it high but it doesn't make it into the all time fav movie"
"i will say it here bcos my friend loves it . but Mat Kilau is a horrible movie in terms of the writing , directing & camerawork . But the casts are amazing with so little things they can work with"
Bad film Mat Kilau here criticism with
"Apsal laaa who tweets and cites that Mat Kilau . . a western movie that doesn't make sense , you can plak accept and praise melambung . . for me it's not bad la malay movie is already as good"
"""Peh Mat Kilau on Netflix ah"" Then I opened it to watch the tmnt animated movie hahaha I wasn't interested after watching the trailer that day again"
The first time I watched Zhaf's movie review video was because I wanted to know if the movie Orphan First Kill was okay . hmm sorry The original video is there . Many people should be disappointed that Mat Kilau's review is beautiful but the reality is . . . hmm it sucks . 
"This is not an honest review problem , but a personal problem but a project with a Mat Kilau movie . Mcm"
"Haha , after it came out on netflix , people just realized that it was overhyped . Maybe it's because the reviewers all give high ratings that it's overhyped . It's not that I don't want to support Malay movies , but in terms of the plot , the movie is normal . For me air force again"
"I don't know if I really like this kind of movie genre , but Mat Kilau is a masterpiece of Malaysia"
I saw mat kilau on netflix with the same reaction in the movie that I watched about 5 times . . hahaha I don't understand the people who make the movie tell me about the story of mat kilau . . hahaha sian eh
"I rarely review a film on social media but here goes Mat Kilau is 0 . 2/10 . I had nothing against our forefathers sacrifice . But it was an overhype movie , the dialog/narrative was poor and there were no Pahang people"
"Look at Mat Kilau , even bitter . I understand the movie very well"
"Just finished watching Mat Kilau on netflix . . . a very good movie , well done . . . can skip"
"if you want to watch Malay movies related to history , watch puteri gunung ledang , 29 februari and lieutenant adnan . please don't waste your time on mat kilau . "
mat kilau is already near netflix . . I don't know when to watch the movie
There are many dialogues that are quite piercing in Mat Kilau's story . A very good
"I'm lucky I don't see the Mat Kilau again , it's ok"
"That's right , if the movie had expired regardless we have downloaded it still cannot watch . But mat kilau en , might be there on the list for a while God willing if you want to finish it"
"I love seeing people commenting on Mat Kilau that it is now on Netflix . That day I said , Mat Kilau , it's not good for anyone to bash me , because I'm not patriotic . Lol it has nothing to do w/ patriotism , mmg the movie needs major revamping before I can say it's acceptable . He didn't follow"
I need
"I'm not that well-versed in story telling but it's not wrong to be critical because I love this kind of movies being made more into our art industry , it's more about giving a good message , like citing mat kilau of course at least The plotline isn't too much"
"Movie Mat Kilau is okay , good try . Its a soap opera about Malay warriors . I want to make it like Ip Man but the cinematography fighting scene is like hauk . Watch the movie"
but if anyone wants to make a badang story please cast fattah amin his action scene in mat kilau movie is
"mat kilau is not as good as yall said it was , i mean the dialogue is disappointing as i expected classic language e . g . pramlee's movie , the color grading does not fit the setting of the film , fighting choreography is okay cun but the camera is not"
"What a rubbish production of this Mat Kilau movie . The cinematography is over the top , the fight sequence is clumsy , the plot of the movie is like spongebob . Lang Buana is the best"
Just finished watching Mat Kilau on Netflix . If there is no Beto Pishang baby . Charisma A++ . Special mention goes to Fattah . Best performance yet . Don't ask me what I think about the movie . I want to make something worth 100 million
"Btw , I don't watch mat kilau on netflix because my mom said it's crazy that she watches movies . What's wrong? At the beginning of the scene , he was jumping between the logs , but the logs had already been released before he jumped . I lost my expectation with this movie . The last fight was good , the guerilla suddenly ambushed stupidly like that 10"
"None of Mat Kilau's history is available . Mat kilau is a catfish for tgk people . Its more of a movie to make Malays realize 'this is ur land , dont chicken out and defend it like what our forefathers did for"
"It's right that many people say that Mat Kilau film is the best , it's really the best , it doesn't make me cry"
"Mat Kilau is out on netflix , I'm tired of watching it"
Luckily he didn't die
F
I'm sure a lot of people will be disappointed with Mat Kilau film and wonder why people are so hyped
"""it's not the best to quote this , it sounds like he's over"" my bro to mat kilau"
"""it's not the best to quote this , it sounds like he's over"" my bro to mat kilau"
"I love history . I love movies . But sorry to say , Mat Kilau is meh . I have written some things that are not logical , but I don't want to share them all on twitter , there are too many . Malaysian directors and team need to watch more international movies to learn"
"I just installed this Mat Kilau a minute ago , it's like this throughout the movie , will there be something interesting later? lazy to throw away"
"Movies like puteri gunung ledang , lieutenant adnan and embun are better to watch than"
"Things that people may think are unnecessary but I want to change in Mat Kilau , right , during the early scene of the fighting chase to introduce the character , instead of covering the faces of Wahid , Awang & Brahim , it's better to cover the faces of Mat Kilau and then reveal them . The title of the movie is Mat"
Rewatching mat kilau with the famz . . . honestly this is the only Malay movie we can watch together
L
Why do I think the movie Mat Kilau is so 'bright'? And the
"Today the movie Mat Kilau is out on Netflix . I'm sorry , am I the only one who thinks this story is overrated? I like Puteri Gunung Ledang again . At the beginning of the Mat Kilau movies , I started asking , was there an inner hood in the old days?"
mama as a history teacher said something wrong w mat kilau the
"I was sitting in front of the tv for almost 2 hours , watching Mat Kilau and yes it was a good movie . I haven't seen a Malay movie that is powerful in every bit of it for a long time"
SALAM SEJAHTERA TENGOH THE MOVIE MAT KILAU IS SUCH A FIRE FOR THE MALAY FIGHTERS IN MALAYSIA TODAY IS MALAYSIA DAY FORGET THE MOVIE PERJUNG MAT KILAU JUST SHOUT MALAYSIA CAN BE ROBBED IN THE COLONIES THE PEOPLE ARE WRONG
"It's true when they say , ""good or bad publicity , publicity is still publicity"" . Just watched Mat Kilau on Netflix . Tbh , it didn't live up to its hype . Bar the politics , this movie was boring and cringey . The storyline was flat . Can't believe this was actually compared to Ip"

"Have you seen the movie Mat Kilau yet? It's out on Netflix today . If so , it's good to raise the flag back to half-mast"
"the biggest mistake coming from the most visible film was the fact that NO ONE used the Pahang accent throughout the whole movie , especially when it was set at Jerantut like come on"
Wow Mat Kilau has entered Netflix . I think the movie with the most quotes and the fastest entry
r
midnight movie for today: Mat Kilau finally got to see . . . me
Mat kilau in Indonesia does not get media coverage like any Indo movie that enters Malaysia!! The Malaysian media always supports every Indo work that enters Malaysia but the media in Indo does not do the same for the work
Where
"Air Force The Movie = Rm27 million (still showing) Film Mat Kilau = Rm97 million Abang Long Fadhil's movie = Rm10 million (still showing) Total = Rm134 million Who says Malaysians don't support Malaysian Films . The important thing is the best film , promotion should be done"
I hope you don't lose the luster like you do in brsilat . But watching air force the movie feels the sacrifice of our army for the sake of the country . The sense of sacrifice that we hope is our own is not always possible . . . Cita is a lot of dead characters
"Air Force , the movie is really hyped , it's like a Mat Kilau finish . Jlan Cita is the best . X clichÃ© , fighting hard . . fighting hard . The path of ambition is crazy . It feels like the sacrifice of a military hero . . There are only one or two characters that stand out . Wlupn core cita psai Rock ngn"
"Mat Kilau was my first Malay movie after more than 10 years (the last time I watched a Malay movie was ombak rindu) After watching Mat Kilau , I would never go to the cinema just to waste my money for the local"
"I was crazy skeptical when I booked to see ATMOS . But , to my own surprise , the opening was awesome . Like . Ooooommmmgggggg . I'm in love . Either I didn't watch Mat Kilau or this movie is awesome . I do not know . But I rate 5 . My sister is so confused by that one character that she freaks out"
"Mat kilau and airforce the movie is supposed to feature an elite group of people , tactical in thinking and well versed in methods to dispose of enemies . However both movies had its climactic final fight taking place in an open field . I would like to understand the rationale of"
"What's the political message behind this new movie , exactly"
honestly malaysia should just focus on this kind of movies mat
"It's kinda ironic that the Mat Kilau movie goes on about how bad the British were , but then it preaches Malay nationalism which is a byproduct of Britain's failure to properly assimilate the non-Malays with the indigenous Malay"
"after the hyped movie mat kilau , Pahang's heroes against the British , Pahang finally flew the flag at half-mast in honor of the death of the empire's ruler"
You should watch the movie about Mat kilau and you'll see
People are tired of making Mat Kilau movies against colonialists . The movie is ready to break the screening record . . . But there are also a few Malaysians who still lick the ass of the former colonialists . Amused
"I want to ask a little , the one who is interested in the Mat Kilau movie reference , don't you study History at school? After watching the movie , will you know about Mat Kilau and the battle against oppressors? If this is the case , just abolish the History subject and replace it with a subject"
So
I don't want . . . facts
Like no
"The thing . . that's the purpose of the movie , from people who don't know about Mat Kilau to know . I will not watch the movie without taking into account his sacrifice"
"Lps mat kilau , many people spread hate towards british for colonizing malaysia and scooping up all the earth's produce . But . . How bou japan? Is it because the movie ""embun"" doesn't top like a Mat Kilau? In conclusion we can't erase history but why bother until you want to play racist"
"The one who said that is gobloq . Ignore it . A lot of people watch Mat Kilau because this is one of the film makers' efforts to build a movie about history after a long time . The effort is pretty good . We also study hero Mat Kilau in school . Therefore , many dtg"
It looks like this anti-British sentiment is different from the post-season of the Mat Kilau movie . It is appropriate for the government to pull Malaysia out of the Commonwealth of Nations if it prioritizes populist views
"You guys are hyped about Mat Kilau because there is a movie about him , right? if there isn't even a little bit , I don't want to know about Mat Kilau , basically"
"I'm not interested in the Mat Kilau movie , but imagine how he felt when he saw the government of the state pouring its own land in the direction of flying the flag at half-mast for three days . "
So the Mat Kilau movie is just to make fun of other nations? Oh cam
Movie Mat Kilau has reached rm90 million in a day . You can continue watching
h
Nobody
"still insane to me Mat Kilau passed endgame in sales LMAO . not that endgame is a cinematic masterpiece , but mat kilau able to harness melayu keris energy . My parents went to see the puppet show! last time they went to the movies was back 06 kot , bullying"
I'm getting confused . . . . What is the purpose of screening the movie Mat Kilau
sorry malay movies never got a place in
I don't think I have to mention how unexplainable everything is in the air force . I have a lot of questions and no answers at the end of the movie . Same as Mat Kilau . And this is not even comparing them to top guns . Serious zero rating for air
"Sorry but after watching air force and mat kilau , Malay writers need to step up or just make drama movies . Redha and pulang are seriously one of the best movies I've"
air force the movie <3333 wayyyy tooo goodddd deserves more hype just like paskal and mat kilau 100% recommended!!! cried twice at the end of the movie hihi everyone so hot and handsome but adi putra my fav encemmmm angattt
Just watched Lieutenant Adnan on Netflix and my conclusion (again for the hundredth time) is:- IT IS 10000000x BETTER THAN MAT KILAU AND IT WAS PRODUCED IN THE YEAR 2000!!! Lieutenant Adnan was and is still the benchmark . Learn from this please @/Directors who want to make war
"Totally agree . It's rubbish when you tell our people to watch Malay movies , people reply , eeiii . . . I'm not used to watching Malay movies . . . I don't know what's going on in my heart . . . I'm so confused that I've turned to Malay"
His color grading is the best bro . First time watching a movie
"That day , in conjunction with independence , he rented a lot of ramps , daggers , clothes in conjunction with the film's Mat Kilau The mcd kangar staff also rent for the 31st"
3 . Mat Kilau I feel sleepy watching this movie but this movie is worth it
"The patient is a 10-year-old boy who comes to wear a brace , does not want to open the tooth extraction time . After seeing Mat Kilau ready to stop studying Taekwondo , take up martial arts . When we want to poke him he's afraid , we're close to him Mat Kilau where he's afraid , keep opening his mouth as wide as possible Really good influence"
"Why aren't many people excited about this Anak Rimau movie? I think Anak Rimau is more attractive than Air Force & Mat Kilau Look at Anak Rimau , you really have nothing to lose"
Personally for me Air Force The Movie - Selagi Bernyawa is a better movie than Mat
"Airforce the movie is also the best . A new leap I think in the Malaysian film war genre . I am sure that after Mat Kilau and Airforce the movie , there will be many more war or historical movies that can compete with Hollywood movies from the genre"
People won't hesitate to spend money on local movies if it's as good as and also Mat Kilau . I also like this one a lot better than
Watched Air Force The Movie: Selagi Bernyawa yesterday with my family . It's AWESOME! My unpopular opinion: still the best from Mat Kilau and Paskal . I like the story line and how suspenseful a war situation can be . I brought me in the situation like I was actually in the
"why is the speaker sound at GSC Kluang so bad , especially at hall 1 when I see the lack of luster then airforce the movie at hall 3 . It's a serious spoiler"
"Easter (10/10) Mat Kilau (9/10) Air force the movie (8/10) BAKARA Police Evo 3 If you want to watch Malaysian movies , you really like action movies , hahaha love love or ghosts , but I don't know if I like it"
"Air Force The Movie is not bad , technically better"
